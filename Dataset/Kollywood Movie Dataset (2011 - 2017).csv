He is sent to China by his guru, who requests him to stop the spread of a pandemic disease existing there from spreading to India. Initially the people in China treat him as an inferior but later when he cures a little girl from the deadly disease and fights against some people who ill treated villagers there, the people of China began to respect and worship him. He begins to teach them how to cure many diseases, the skills of hypnotism and the physical training of the Shaolin monks that led to the creation of Shaolinquan. However, after several years, when he expresses his desire to return to India, the villagers plot to poison him and bury him near the temple, believing that their place would be disease free if he is buried there. Bodhidharma agrees to die and subsequently becomes a fundamental figure in Chinese history, affectionately being dubbed as ""Damo"".
In modern-day China, Dong Lee (Johnny Tri Nguyen) is given the task of starting a government-planned biological war against India, known as Operation Red. Dong Lee arrives in Chennai and starts this operation by injecting a virus into a street dog. This disease was the one which occurred during the time of Bodhidharma in China. Meanwhile, Subha Srinivasan (Shruti Haasan), a student of genetics researches that Bodhidharma can be brought back to life if his sample of DNA is matched with another sample of DNA which she finds in Aravind (Suriya) a descendant of Bodhidharma who is working as a circus artist nearby. Dong Lee finds out Subha's mission to revive Bodhidharma and plans to kill her first, so that the disease cannot be stopped.
Subha approaches Aravind, but begins to love him and spends time with him, and thereby forgetting about her mission. One day, Aravind's family see Subha and clearly remember that she visited them a year before to find Aravind and know all about him for the Bodhidharma research.

But Dong Lee, who is capable of doing anything, does all impossibly bad things, mastered in ""Nokku Varmam"" (hypnotism), a martial art which was actually taught to the Chinese by Bodhidharma.
Subha goes to her genetics department and announces that Operation Red can be stopped if they read and make use of the cures in a book written by Bodhidharma. However, the department laughs and refuses to believe her, claiming that an ancient book is of no use in modern times, much to Subha's dismay. After some time, Subha and Aravind learn that Subha's professor from the genetics department is assisting Dong Lee in Operation Red. They sneak into the professor's apartment and learn about the operation. The next day, the professor is caught red-handed by Aravind, Subha and her friends, but surrenders and explains that he received a huge sum of money from the China government if he carried out Operation Red. After the professor gives the gang more details about Operation Red and how to stop it, they leave. However, after a while, Dong Lee arrives and the professor once again teams up with him to save his own life.
Dong Lee causes numerous havoc in the city, which Subha, Aravind and their gang barely escape. They finally locate a research centre where they can activate Bodhidharma's DNA in Aravind, and decide to hide there for a few days. They all deactivate their phones so that no-one can trace them.

2012,Nanban,Tamil,Shankar,"Vijay, Jiiva, Srikanth, Ileana D'Cruz",comedy-drama,"Venkat Ramakrishnan (Srikanth), Sevarkodi Senthil (Jiiva) and Panchavan Parivendan alias Pari (Vijay) are three first year engineering students who share a room in the hostel of Ideal Engineering College (IEC), Chennai. While Venkat and Senthil are average students who come from a modern background, Pari is from a rich family. Venkat studies engineering as per his father's wishes, over his own wish – to become a wildlife photographer, while Senthil, whose family is poor, studies engineering to improve his family's financial situation and get his sister married. Pari, however, studies engineering for his simple passion for machines and devices. He believes that one should follow excellence, not success, as success will take care of itself if excellence is followed. This approach to studies is sneered upon by the dean of the college, Professor Virumandi ""Virus"" Santhanam (Sathyaraj). Virus and the faculty favour Pari's classmate Srivatsan alias Silencer (Sathyan) who believes in mindless rote learning over understanding to reach his goals of corporate status. Pari constantly spars with Virus and Silencer due to their differences in their educational approaches.
Pari falls in love with Virus' daughter Ria (Ileana D'Cruz), a medical student when he, Venkat and Senthil accidentally gatecrash her elder sister Swetha's (Anuya Bhagvath) wedding reception to obtain a free meal. Ria is not impressed with Pari's antics and complains to her father about them. Virus becomes furious with Pari and his friends and tries to break their friendship by claiming that the ""rich"" Pari is a bad influence on the ""less privileged"" Venkat and Senthil. While Venkat refuses to break his friendship with Pari, Senthil believes Virus and distances himself from Pari, though they reconcile when Pari saves the life of Senthil's paralysed father, who had suffered a heart attack, by taking him to hospital on Ria's scooter when the ambulance had not arrived on time. Ria too appreciates Pari's practicality and concern for others and reciprocates Pari's feelings. In the yearly exam, Pari stands first in his class, while both Venkat and Senthil come last.
Three years later, during their final year, Pari, Venkat and Senthil break into Virus's house drunk one night to allow Pari to propose to Ria. Venkat and Senthil, who are both drunk, cause a ruckus and urinate on the front door before fleeing. Virus notices Senthil and the next day, he threatens to expel him unless he snitches on Pari. Not wanting to betray his friend or let down his family, Senthil attempts suicide by jumping from Virus' office window and ends up in a coma. However, Senthil soon recovers and following his recovery, he discards his fear of the future. His frankness impresses the interviewers from a company during a campus placement drive and they hire him. Meanwhile, Venkat successfully convinces his parents to allow him to pursue his wildlife photography dream.
Virus, enraged at Senthil's success, sets an extremely hard final exam to fail Senthil, as the job offer is contingent on graduation. When Ria learns of her father's plan, she helps Pari and Venkat to leak the question paper by providing them with the keys to her father's office. However, Virus catches them and expels them as well as Senthil on the spot. Ria angrily confronts her father, revealing that her late brother committed suicide because he was unable to get into IEC as his father had desired, despite having ambitions of becoming a writer. Meanwhile, Swetha, who is pregnant, goes into labour. A heavy thunderstorm cuts all power and floods the streets, making it impossible for the ambulance to reach Swetha. Pari, Venkat and Senthil deliver the baby using available equipment and an inverter developed by Pari, with Ria instructing him via VoIP. After the newborn baby is apparently stillborn, Pari manages to resuscitate the baby. Virus forgives Pari and his friends, and allows them to write their final exams. After the convocation however, Pari disappears and goes into seclusion.
Ten years later, Venkat, who is now a successful wildlife photographer and Senthil, who is married, has a good middle class life, and works as a software engineer in the company he was ten years ago set out on a journey to Ooty to find Pari, since he is last claimed to be found there by Silencer. They are joined by Silencer, who is now a wealthy and successful professional businessman, who is a vice president in his own company, while also being married and having kids in the United States, who is looking to seal a deal with Kosaksi Pasapugazh, a famous scientist and prospective business associate. Silencer's main intention in finding Pari is to see whether Pari is more successful than him; they had made a bet in their first year of engineering on who would be more successful with their study approaches. However, when they reach Pari's house in Ooty, they find a completely different man: the real Panchavan Parivendan (S. J. Surya).
Confronting Parivendan, Venkat and Senthil learn that their friend was actually a destitute servant boy nicknamed Pappu. Pappu, who worked in Parivendan's household, loved learning, while Parivendan disliked studies. After noticing the boy's intelligence, Parivendan's father (Ajay Rathnam) agreed to allow Pappu to study in his place instead of working as a servant. In return, Parivendan would pocket Pappu's qualifications and after graduating, Pappu should cease all contact with him and his family. Parivendan reveals that Pappu is now a schoolteacher in Dhanushkodi. Later, Venkat and Senthil discover that as ""Pari"" had disappeared, Ria had decided to marry her former boyfriend – a price obsessed banker whom she had dumped when ""Pari"" made her realise that he loves his expensive items more than her. Venkat and Senthil rescue Ria from her wedding in Coimbatore and they, along with Silencer, drive to Dhanushkodi.
At ""Pari's"" school, Venkat and Senthil reunite with their long-lost friend, Ria and ""Pari"" rekindle their romance, and Silencer mocks ""Pari"" for becoming a lowly schoolteacher.

2012,Ambuli,Tamil,Hari Shankar Hareesh Narayan,"R. Parthiban, R. Ajai, P. S. Srijith, Sanam Shetty",fantasy,"The film begins with happening in the corn fields in a village in the South India, where a British forest ranger, who is in charge of the fields, has being alerted by some strange noises coming from deep inside the fields. He sets out with his dog and searches for the source of this strange noise, then suddenly the dog is being dragged inside and brutally killed by an unknown beast creature. Then the British forest ranger is also dragged inside and killed by the creature. Then the film shifts to the 1970s, where a college farewell party for Sir Arthur Wellington College is taking place. Two college friends, Amudhan and Vendhan, who is the son of the alcoholic college watchman, Vethagiri have decide to stay back in the college hostel and spend the vacation there. This is mainly because Amudhan's college girlfriend Poongavanam, who lives in the nearby village of Poomanandhipuram, where her father is the village landlord, so that he can't miss her during the vacation. The only thing that lies between the college and the village is the same corn field, which is now currently being protected by a big wall, that is believed to be the hunting grounds of the strange creature, that the people now call Ambuli. Though some people called it a myth, many believed that Ambuli did exist. One night, despite warnings from Vendhan, Amudhan decides to go through the corn field to reach Poomanandhipuram to meet Poongavanam. He makes the first trip successfully, but while he returns, he hears the same strange noise and is chased and thrown off his cycle by Ambuli, which is not yet shown on screen. Amudhan runs for his life and reaches the college, where he meets Vendhan, narrates him what happened, and reveals to him that Ambuli is real. Vendhan is little convinced by Amudhan's narration of his story and they both decide to visit the corn field together that night to see what really is happening. They both travel the entire field and reach one corner and find a wooden cabin, which is the very place where the British forest ranger once lived, and they meet Sengodan there. Sengodan guards the fields, but his looks cause a little bit of suspicion to Amudhan and Vendhan that he might be Ambuli. But Sengodan does not harm them and Amudhan and Vendhan escape the cabin.
The next day, Amudhan and Vendhan ask Vethagiri about Ambuli and about Sengodan. Vethagiri is very much angered by the news that they both travelled alone at night in the corn fields and tell them that death awaits whoever enters the field at night, as Ambuli lives there, that has killed so many people in the past and is still hungry for human life. Vethagiri, upon being asked whether Ambuli is real, he revealed that he had once seen Ambuli committed a murder in the corn fields, causing him to become an alcoholic to get rid of his fear of Ambuli. Before becoming an alcoholic, he planned to leave the village with Vendhan from Ambuli, but was unable to, when someone from Sir Arthur Welling College had given Vendhan a seat in the college, which Vethagiri accepted. He explains that Vendhan is the only person he has got and if something happens to him, he can't live. So, he humbly requests them not to go there again. But, he still accepts to tell them about Ambuli and Sengodan. About some 40 years ago, on the day of Solar eclipse, a pregnant woman named Ponni, who has no one except her elder child, walks into the village of Poomanandhipuram, but faints right under the sun, which it was believed that one who comes out on a solar eclipse, will be affected badly by the radiation. The villagers rescue her and she gives birth to a baby child the very night. But the baby, that was born was not exactly a human being. It was half human and half beast like a neanderthal. The baby then bites on the left arm of the village lady doctor, Seemati and it also attacks and kills another women fatally. The villagers then locked both Ponni and Ambuli in the house. Ponni, who was given a choice of either to destroy Ambuli, decides to let Ambuli go, while committing suicide, unable to face the humiliation. Ambuli escapes into the fields, and it has been till date been killing humans. Vethagiri also reveals that Sengoden is a murderer. Vethagiri remarks and points out that Amudhan and Vendhan are lucky not to be harmed by Sengoden. This is the story Vethagiri explained to both Amudhan and Vendhan .
Vendhan and Amudhan decide to collect more details about Ambuli. So, they visit many people in the village and enquire about Ambuli. During at that time, Vendhan fell in love with Valarmalai, who is a tuition master's daughter and Poongavanam's friend. They meet one of the senior students at Sir Arthur Wellington College, Marudhan, who is a practical youth and does not believe in Ambuli at all. But ironically, Marudhan's grandma is the village lady doctor, Seemati whose left arm was bitten by Ambuli at its childbirth. They find a painting of Ambuli from another senior student of the college, Velpari who writes a journal in the previous edition of the college magazine about the mass migration of people from the Poomanandhipuram village into another village, due to the fear of Ambuli and is currently running a rice mill. With this painting as a proof, they try to make a complaint in the police station, where the head police officer demand they need at least a photograph as a proof and not a painting. Vendhan and Amudhan accept the challenge and decides to visit the corn fields to take a picture of Ambuli. But they are once again interrupted by Sengodan killing Gugan, one of the villagers, who attempted to kill Ambuli to revenge for the death of his daughter, who is one of Ambuli's victims and they take a picture of him, thinking that he is Ambuli, only for them to get shocked at this fact, that Sengoden is revealed to be none other than the elder brother of Ambuli by Vethagiri, the next day, when they had attempted to make him stop his drinking habit and show him proof that Sengodan is Ambuli. Vethagiri also revealed that Sengodan killed the founder of the college, Sir Arthur Wellington, who was his first victim and had caused him to be viewed as a murderer in the villagers.
One night, as things went this way, Marudhan gets very curious about Ambuli, and decides to investigate things on his own. Thus, he secretly follows a villager, who takes a full grown goat with him, and ties it to a small boat and sends into the lake, that lies ahead of the old caves of a temple, that are now abandoned by the villagers. Marudhan watches the boat float away and the goat is now gone. He understands that the villagers were paying sacrifice to Ambuli to vent his anger. So the next day, he decides to see what lies ahead of the lake. He goes in the same boat and enters the caves where he encounters Ambuli. Terrified, he runs for his life and escapes from the caves. Now having started to believe in Ambuli, he enquires about it to Seemati. At the same time, Amudhan and Vendhan check for some details in the college library about Ambuli. They enter Sir Arthur Wellington's room, which was not opened at all for years and find an important clue about a book about Gandhi located in a book shelf in the college library on his table. They found the book shelf where they find a key inside the book about Gandhi on the shelf, which can unlock a secret Projector room hidden behind the book shelf in the library, which also contains a chemical lab that has been locked for years. They find some projector reels and old documents in a drawer and start watching and reading them, while at the same time Seemati narrates to Marudhan what actually happened to Ponni and why Ambuli was born like a beast. What follows is a very terrible truth that entirely shocks Amudhan, Vendhan and Marudhan.
Sir Arthur Wellington, who is not only the founder of his self-named college in the southern parts of India, but was also basically a scientist having worked with the British army during World War II. After his retirement, he begins the college in South India. His longtime goal is to successfully carry out and finish his project, which is to create humans who can live for 150 years healthily. He decides to use Ponni as his specimen/test subject and injects any kind of his chemicals into her womb. This starts having an impact on Ambuli. Sir Wellington dopes her with strong sedatives, so that she visits him often for checkup, so that he can carry out his test without any problem. As she reaches her pregnancy date, she is affected too much by the sedatives and starts heading to Sir Wellington's laboratory to get herself checked. That day turns out to be the Solar eclipse, and unfortunately, she is affected by the radiation form of the eclipse. This causes a big change in her womb and thus Ambuli is born as a beast. Seemati, who checked her pregnancy and is terrified by the looks and behavior of Ambuli, tells Ponni to kill Ambuli right then and there. But she lets Ambuli escape and commits suicide out of humiliation. Angered by this, Sengoden kills Sir Wellington, who is the reason for all this.
Now having collected all details about Ambuli, Amudhan, Vendhan and Marudhan decide that there is no use for all of them including the villagers hiding from Ambuli and they must fight against it or else they all will die of fear. Marudhan tried to a strong mass of villagers to hunt down and destroy Ambuli for good, but failed because of the refusal of the village landlord. Poongavanam and Valarmalai decided to check on Amudhan and Vendhan that night, having been well aware of their investigation on Ambuli. Both the tuition master and the landlord discovered their disappearances that night. So the landload accepts Marudhan's plan and the villagers gather as a strong mass and set out to hunt and destroy Ambuli for good, headed by Marudhan. Poongavanam somehow got trapped between thorn bushes in the corn fields, but is helped by Sengodan, only for Sengodan to caputre and gagged her at the cabin. Amudhan and Vendhan arrived to find Sengodan, only to find Poongavanam there, tied up and gagged. Amudhan and Vendhan then revealed to Poongavanam that of Ambuli's location, only for Sengodan to overhear their conversation and offering to go along with them. While setting out to meet Ambuli, Valarmalai attempted to attacked Sengodan, thinking he got Amudhan, Vendhan, and Poongavanam captives, only to stopped by them and ended joining along with them. They visit the caves at night, and there comes a tall, fierce looking ape like creature, which is finally shown and revealed to be Ambuli. As Ambuli tries to attack the group, Sengodan fights it bravely. The villagers also rush to the caves. Then suddenly the army and the police arrives there with tranquilizers, having been alerted by the head police officer, who is convinced by Amudhan and Vendhan that Ambuli does exist, thanks to the projector room, the chemical lab, the old documents, and the projector reels from Sir Arthur Wellington College. After an intense battle in the field between the army, the police, and Ambuli, Ambuli is tranquilized with the help of Sengodan. The army captures Ambuli and he is taken away in a secured box. Sengodan is heavily and critically injured by Ambuli, manages to survive from the fight between him and Ambuli. Amudhan and Vendhan apologized to him for suspecting him as Ambuli. Sengodan revealed that he wanted to kill and destroy Ambuli, right after killing Sir Wellington, but was only unfortunately, arrested by the police and put in jail as a result, only for to be released years later til now. When asked By Amudhan And Vendhan on why he killed Gugan and kidnapped Poongavanam, Sengodan revealed that he had mistaken Gogan as Ambuli and that, he was also trying to save Poongavannam from Ambuli. The villagers finally thank Marudhan, Sengodan, Amudhan and Vendhan for their heroics in capturing Ambuli and thus, ending their long time fear.
As the credits roll out, a final shot is shown which is to happen in Dehradun, where the box in which Ambuli is being carried. The box slowly starts moving a little and it cracks suddenly. It is to be understood that Ambuli escapes from the box and sets on his next hunt. The film ends with a line in Tamil, which means in English, Ambuli's hunt will continue!",5.3

As Ram and Latha are driving home, they are followed by a red lorry, which attempts to kill both Ram and Latha. Ram manages to push Latha off the car as well as saving himself. Ram is seriously hurt and is taken to the hospital by Latha. Latha then speaks to the doctor, her uncle (Jayaprakash). Latha explains the doctor that she knows Ram personally and doesn't understand why Ram doesn't recognize her. Ram being unconscious, begins to mutter Charu's name. While Ram and Charu's uncle are having a brief conversation, Latha listens in. It is revealed that Ram and Charu used to work together for a competition and Ram fell in love with Charu from the moment that he met her. It came to a situation where Charu goes to a club to meet a work friend after having found out that her laptop data had been corrupted and she is unable to reach her work. She goes to the club to get a USB backup of her laptop data, before having been teased by drunk guys. These two guys happen to be the two guys Ram tries to kill at the beginning of the film.
Charu goes to the police station to report the two guys who teased her, however, the guys did not take this well and threaten Charu. Ram witnesses this and assumes that there is a problem, however, Charu ensures Ram that he has nothing to worry about and that everything has been sorted.
On the day of the competition, Ram and Charu go through their presentation, to make sure that they have got everything that they need. Ram looks behind him and notices that he has forgotten something. He explains to Charu that he needs to go back, but will be back in time for the competition. Charu being hesitant at first eventually agrees. Ram went back to get the gift that he has bought Charu, so that he can give to her when he proposes his love for her, after the competition.
Ram then manages to go the competition venue on time, however, sees the two guys who teased Charu inside the venue. Ram jumps to the conclusion that the guys have come after Charu and are here to kill her. Ram tries to find them however fails. Ram then reaches the balcony where he witnesses Charu being taken into a car by two guys, which he assumes are the two teasers. Ram then runs after the car but then loses the car and is pushed on the side of the road, where he becomes delusional. He then goes home, and waits for Charu without changing his clothes or having a shower. He sits in one position for two days. Charu then comes home safe and sound, and is revealed to the doctor that him and Charu have been together ever since.
The doctor comes out of the room to see a shocked Latha. Latha then reveals to her uncle (the doctor) that her family know her as Latha, but she introduced herself to Ram as Charu, as her name was indeed Charulatha. Latha then reveals what actually happen; Ram went to get the present, while she was left to handle the presentation herself, and ends up winning the whole competition, Her father was a main judge on the competition and was also revealed that this competition was built to see how Charu can handle a whole business and would take over from her father. It was then revealed that Ram would not get a position in this company at all, and with Charu feeling guilty, she calls after Ram, which Ram hears and sees. She was taken into the car by her father which made it look like she was being kidnapped to Ram.
The doctor then persuades Latha to act like the Charu that she was while living with him. At first she disagrees, however, after Ram gains his consciousness, Ram receives a call from a so-called 'Charu'. Latha goes back to Bangalore, where she visits the woman who is acting as Charu to Ram over the phone. It is revealed that a blind woman acts as Charu, only because Ram keeps calling her and asking about her and refuses to believe that this isn't Charu's number. Latha then breaks into her old Bangalore home, and spies on Ram, with her uncle assisting her. Ram comes home and assumingly hugs a so-called Charu. We then realise that it isn't actually Charu he is hugging, but he is hugging nothing but an empty space.
Latha then asks her uncle what had happened to Ram. Ram is suffering from severe delusions and is imagining that Charu is still present with him, hence the reason why Ram didn't recognise her in the first place.

It is revealed that her fiance Vicky, is in fact gay and his friends can not accept Vicky getting married to any girl who gets in his way which includes Latha. The two guys attempt on killing Latha but is defeated by Ram. Ram then attempts to save Latha by taking her to the hospital but is then hit on the head. Ram gains his consciousness and goes home and waits for Charu at home, sitting in a position for two days, waiting for Charu. The delusion he sees is Charu coming back to him, in tears and saying that she is alright. Ram bursts into tears and goes to have a shower so that he can relax and start over with Charu. Latha however is still in hospital with her father and uncle by her side. Her uncle reveals that it was him who hit Ram on the head, so that he can take Latha to the hospital to get her checked out, yet he explains to Charu that she better of with Ram as he will keep her happy.

Unaware of the incident, Bindu proposes to the dying Nani by telephone; it is the last thing Nani hears before he is reincarnated as a housefly that cannot remember its previous life.
The fly's memory is triggered when it encounters Sudeep and Bindu. Sudeep asks the heartbroken Bindu to accompany him to New Delhi to meet the education minister; if she can impress the minister with a presentation about the NGO, he might help it gain national recognition. The fly causes Sudeep to have an accident on his way to the airport and writes ""I will kill you"" on the windshield; this makes Sudeep paranoid. The fly, who sees Bindu mourning Nani's death in her bedroom, reveals itself to be Nani by writing on the desk with her tears. It conveys the circumstances of Nani's death to Bindu, and they join forces against Sudeep. The latter's obsession with the fly affects his professional and personal life. In a chain of events, his money is burnt to ashes, leaving him almost penniless.[c]
Sudeep learns from a sorcerer that Nani is reincarnated as a fly and seeks revenge. Sudeep arranges to kill Nani but the fly escapes and causes a short circuit, killing the sorcerer and leaving Sudeep unconscious. Nani and Bindu assume Sudeep is dead but he is saved by his business partner. Sudeep is enraged when he learns that Bindu is helping the fly. Sudeep kills his partner to collect a ₹7 billion (US$107.49 million) insurance policy.
Sudeep takes Bindu to his home and Nani follows them. Nani seriously injures Sudeep with a needle. The latter clips Nani's wing and fatally stabs him with the same needle. Nani jumps through the flame of a burning match then into a loaded cannon, which fires. The projectile passes through Sudeep and hits an oxygen cylinder, which explodes and kills him. Bindu takes the fly's wing and makes an amulet with it. One day when travelling to work, an eve teaser bothers her; Nani, again reborn as a fly, attacks him with a needle before announcing his return.
The young girl is impressed with the story of the fly her father narrates.",7.7

The scene shifts to the same place after exactly a year, where a blind man Kenny Thomas (Vikram) lays flowers on the memorial and mourns someone's death during the bomb blast. He is then given some secret details by a mysterious woman. Kenny then takes a taxi driven by Sathyan (Santhanam), who is a comical Tamil guy. He drops Kenny at a place and waits for him to return. But Kenny actually goes inside to kill someone. He kills him and throws him down. Seeing the corpse, Sathyan flees. During this entire scene, Kenny is shown to produce a sound from his mouth, to find his way, which is later shown as echolocation. Later Kenny is shown to play piano in a local church, and as he is blind, he has so many people who care for him. In the meantime, Kenny carries out two more murders, taking the same taxi driven by the innocent Sathyan, following instructions from the mysterious woman.
Sara Vinayagam (Amy Jackson), a British-born Indian girl, wins the Miss London title, and to build her social profile, she goes to Kenny's church and acts like she is helping out there. Initially, Kenny does not like her, but eventually, they become friends. Sara's father is a doctor, who supports Kenny as he is blind. Police officer Veerakathi (Nasser), a British Tamil, is the officer in charge of the murders. As the autopsy of the murdered victims takes place under Sara's father, Veerakathi visits him and comes to know about Kenny, who is admitted there for a small accident. Veerakathi initially suspects Kenny but is not convinced that he is the murderer. As Sathyan is found on all the murder spots, the police arrest him, suspecting that he must be having a connection with the murders. But Sathyan manages to find a picture of Kenny from a local newspaper and informs Veerakathi. Sathyan is released and he meets Sara, and both of them go to a place (which she comes to know from Kenny's phone, which he misses during a fight with the local thugs). They reach there in time to see Kenny almost kill a guy named Victor (a steel company owner). But Kenny flees the scene after seeing them and takes Sathyan's taxi to escape.

Shiva and Sarath are very close friends. Meantime Shiva gets married to Meenakshi (Anushka Shetty), who is an eye doctor in Delhi. They both have the same views on marriage that one should first meet someone, become friends, fall in love, and then get married, but as their marriage happens in a hurry, they decide that they must first become friends. As time goes by, they become closer to each other and almost become the complete pair. Meenakshi decides to express her love to Shiva on New Year's Day (which turns out to be his birthday).
In the Meantime, Sharath handles a case where an Indian Army secret (a flowchart) about a WMD goes missing. Shiva shows interest in this case and he goes to London (with a different name, where a former Indian Policeman named Kenny helps him) to find an important clue, as Sharath is injured during a fight, but Shiva is shocked to find his plan go terribly wrong and is now chased by the London police, following a few incidents.

Consequently, she is murdered, but, she swallows a pen-drive containing evidences of the foul-play before dying. Anjali acquires it from the person who performs Volga’s autopsy. She hands the pen-drive over to Vimalan. Following this, Vimalan and Akhilan are confronted by goons who try to get the pen-drive from him.

She is an aspiring novelist and is researching for writing a horror story, whereas Michael does not believe in supernatural powers, but is afraid of anything supernatural. Anu, keeps telling him that he would soon realize the presence of supernatural beings. At first, Michael is confused and scared, and his fears are confirmed when he comes to know his boss, i.e., the Pizza restaurant owner Shanmugam's (Aadukalam Naren) daughter is possessed by a spirit. Meanwhile, Anu becomes pregnant, and after a brief altercation, Michael and Anu get covertly married. One particular day, Michael goes out to deliver a pizza to a customer and returns to the restaurant in a state of shock while covered in blood; he is apparently injured, keeps constantly muttering Anu's name, and seems to be worried about her. When his boss questions him, Michael explains that he had been to deliver a pizza to a customer named Smitha (Pooja Ramachandran) in a bungalow and recounts the events that happened at the bungalow.
Smitha requests Michael to wait downstairs while she goes upstairs to retrieve change. Almost immediately, there is power failure, which alarms Michael. While waiting downstairs completely alone in the dark, Michael hears a loud unidentifiable noise from the bedroom upstairs. Going up to investigate, he finds Smitha murdered suspiciously and notices one slice the pizza he had delivered to be missing, suggesting that there may be somebody else in the house. Horrified, Michael makes a dash for the door only to realize that it has been locked from the outside. Further more when the murdered woman's husband Bobby (Bobby Simha) arrives, he at first believes he stumbles upon his wife having an affair. Through his cellphone Michael communicates with Bobby and explains his situation thoroughly instigating Bobby to aid him on how to get out of the house. Moreover, Bobby suddenly disappears from the front entrance, and is found by Michael inside the house mysteriously murdered in the same room as his wife, with two slices of the pizza now missing. Also, Michael encounters the couple's child ""Nithya"", identical to the name of the spirit allegedly possessing Shanmugam's daughter.
Michael tries everything he can to get out of the house including trying to break down the sealed doors leading outside, to using the house phone which happens to work even though the line is dead.

The police disclose that Michael is a suspect regarding the murder case and attempt to arrest him. Confused and in tears, Michael does not believe the policemen and attempts to escape the clutches of these police men in order to go in search of Anu.
While trying to escape, Michael witnesses the police getting dragged into the house and being killed. At this juncture, Michael, in a horrified state, runs back to the restaurant. While Michael is not convinced that Anu is dead, his friends at the restaurant and Shanmugam start realizing that they had never seen Anu; they also observe that Michael's home does not have any evidence that he lived with Anu. Further, it is revealed that the haunted bungalow had witnessed the untimely deaths of a married couple, their daughter, and two policeman, whose ghosts Michael had earlier interacted with. Meanwhile, Michael seems to continue his search for Anu, has constant health issues, and seems to be disturbed by ghosts and supernatural entities.
As Michael during a delivery stops and calls Anu, the true story of what had happened is disclosed. The Income Tax department had planned on a raid at the restaurant owner Shanmugam's house. Shanmugam who has diamonds worth around 20 million hidden in his restaurant hides it in a box of candies and asks Michael to deliver it to his house.

So, they concoct a clever story in which Michael convincingly ""forgets"" the Pizza bag at the ""haunted"" bungalow which Shanmugam would never enter into, thanks to his fear of supernatural powers. Meanwhile, Anu has left to Kochi via Bengaluru with the diamonds and her belongings, and has obtained fake documentation using which Michael and Anu can settle abroad.
Michael, after the phone call, goes to deliver a pizza to a house and he encounters a series of events similar to the story he had narrated.

Sakthi's character is as such that he does not remember even a single detail in their love life that Rupa deems important. Rupa tells Sakthi that he does not seem to have the time for a girlfriend, and that he does not even care to do so. Rupa further aggravates the situation by asking Sakthi to close his eyes and tell her the colour of the dress she was wearing right then, but Sakthi finds that he could not. Grieved, Rupa leaves Sakthi, saying this was his character and that he would not change.
After three months, Sakthi still had not recovered from his break-up. However, he receives a courier from his girlfriend saying that she misses him, and a flight ticket to Bangkok where she resides now. Sakthi is overjoyed, and leaves for Bangkok. Being his first trip to a foreign country, Sakthi seeks help from his beautiful co-passenger Maya (Trisha). They end up becoming friends and Sakthi tells Maya about his lady love.
In Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, Sakthi and Maya part ways, and Sakthi makes his way to the Buddhist Temple where Rupa had written in the letter that she would meet him at. Although he waits for hours, Rupa doesn't turn up. At night, IPS Officer Muthumaran (Sampath Raj) checks on him, saying that he wasn't allowed to stay at the temple at night. Upon learning that Sakthi is a Tamilian just like himself, he offers him a place to stay while Sakthi finds his girlfriend. However, Muthumaran does imply that he does not trust women, and that Sakthi should not get his hopes up high that Rupa will come looking for him. Another day, in a case of mistaken identity, Sakthi gets caught up in the middle of a shootout between two gangs, one intent on protecting him and the other seemingly hell-bent to riddle him full of holes. As the gang protecting Sakthi gain the upperhand in the firefight, they whisk him away to a posh hotel in a luxury car. Sakthi is confused and doesn’t understand why he was dragged off.
A magazine in the seat next to him in the car attracts his attention and to his shock, Sakthi sees an exact look-alike on the cover of the magazine. It turns out that his doppelgänger, remarkably also named Sakthi, is a multi-millionaire tycoon who is adored by many and targeted by a few in Bangkok. He doesn’t know how to prove his identity as everything stands against him. Things get bizarre as Trekker Sakthi has been forcefully dropped into the role of Tycoon Sakthi and situations seem to prove him as someone he was not.
In the hotel, Trekker Sakthi argues with the Tycoon Sakthi's personal assistant Manohar (John Vijay) about his true identity. He takes out his passport and shows it to Manohar. An amused Manohar gives the passport back to Trekker Sakthi and asks if it was true that he was merely the son of a forest ranger, why would he have multiple visas of so many countries, which was expected in a businessman's passport. To his horror, Trekker Shakthi finds that his ordinary, rarely travelled Indian passport has inexplicably turned into a Thai passport with visas to several countries like Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Sakthi enlists the helps of Maya, who brings him to a branch of Bangkok Bank to recover his details, hoping there would be a discrepancy somewhere to help Trekker Sakthi prove he was not Tycoon Sakthi.
In a turn of events, when Trekker Sakthi signs his signature to access the Tycoon's bank account balance hoping that his different signature might be proof enough, the bank's security system shows that his signature was an exact match – and that he had a little over half a billion US dollars in his account. At this juncture, even Maya starts to suspect that both Sakthis are the same person. Sakthi gets further and further mangled in more trouble with his assumed identity.
After a long cat and mouse game, Sakthi spots Manohar again, not in a business suit as before, but as a pimp in the streets. Sakthi gives chase and beats him up enough to find out the truth – that he was being played by two ruthless, psychotic businessmen watching his every move through hidden cameras, who have orchestrated all the bizarre situations Sakthi had found himself in before Manohar reveals the names he gets shot and falls down in the hole. Shakthi is blamed for the murder and police does not believe his situation. Shakthi comes to know that Rupa had never written the letter. Two business tycoons Rajesh Arunachalam (Manoj Bajpai) and John Frederick (J. D. Chakravarthy) happen to be friends from childhood, born in rich families. They play a game creating problematic situations intentionally for unsuspecting people choosing randomly placing bets on them to determine whether they survive or not.
In present, both villains bring a person posing as Maya's boyfriend Rohit (Narayan Lucky) to provoke the anger of Sakthi so that he would show his anger towards Maya. Sakthi plays the same game back at the villains with Maya, by pretending to slap and kill her (two villains think that Maya is really dead). Maya stands in a road where villains were travelling and they think her as ghost, they panic, lose control of the car and become unconscious. Next day, Rajesh and John find themselves staying in a suite owned by them and a news broadcast shocks them – to the whole world, John and Rajesh are dead and their funeral is taking place. They run away and end up before Shakthi and Maya. Joseph Kuriyan (Jayaprakash), Muthumaran, and Jayakumar (Sriman), the people who were involved in the game arrive there, and the film ends with Shakthi and Maya walking away from the seaside while the sound of a pistol is heard which indicates that both villains are killed.",6.4

Blaming the good-hearted Sam for his ouster, Bergmans vows revenge and challenges to prove that evil does reign supreme in this world. Sam finishes his education and training and arrives at a village as the new Father of the local church. A local boy named Thomas of this village who is the illegitimate son of a local fisherman Chetty (Ponvannan) has grown up in a rough neighborhood, following the death of his mother and thus being forced to fend for himself.
Father Sam takes the run down church and the skeptical villagers in his stride and soon starts bringing about changes. Through a series of incidents, he also manages to get the unruly Thomas under his control and gets him to learn the tricks of the fishing trade from the villagers. The film fast forwards a few years when Thomas is now all grown up (Gautham Karthik) and is very close to Father Sam who is now a well respected person in the village.
Thomas comes across Bea (short for Beatrice) (Thulasi Nair) when she's running away from her convent school group who had gotten her admitted to hospital. They keep running into each other a few times and Thomas comes to like her presence.
Meanwhile, as Father Sam is meditating on the remote beach, he hears a few gunshots on the sands. On investigation, he finds an unconscious Bergmans in the waters. On seeing that the shooters are still lurking around trying to finish their job of killing Bergmans, he pulls him to safety into an abandoned ship, and takes care of his bullet injuries with the help of a local village woman as well as a woman Celina (Lakshmi Manchu) from a distant village that Bergmans asks him to get. A few villagers including Chetty who see Father Sam running around in the dark with the 2 women get suspicious and accuse the three of sleeping together. They call the Bishop, upon whose interrogation, Celina admits to the sin, and Father Sam gets unfairly implicated. One of the villagers is also killed in the ensuing mêlée and Father Sam is sentenced to 4 years rigorous imprisonment.
Bergmans visits Father Sam in prison and admits he got the woman to implicate him falsely, to prove that evil will always triumph. When Father Sam returns from prison, he discovers Thomas has fallen in cahoots with the evil Bergmans in his smuggling trade and has committed many sins in his desire to make the village people bow before him. Thomas and Bea have also fallen in love with each other and come to seek Father Sam's blessings. Thomas subsequently gets to know that Bea is none other than the estranged daughter of Bergmans, who does not want to have to do anything with her.
Thomas takes Bea to Bergmans' house to trigger some long-lost memories when she recalls all the previous horrific incidents of her father Bergmans, including the one of killing her mother. Bergmans gets angry with all this and abducts both Father Sam and Bea in his boat and goes out to sea with an intent to kill them both. However, even after a few feeble attempts, the self-professed son of Satan who disavows all family attachment, is unable to get himself to kill his daughter. Thomas comes chasing them and after a long drawn fight amongst the three, Thomas and Father Sam together manage to subdue the evil Bergmans.
The movie ends on a note that good finally triumphs over evil, whether it be Father Sam and Thomas' triumph over Bergmans, Thomas' own suppressing of his bad inclination and re-joining forces with Father Sam, or Bergmans' good nature coming out in his inability to kill his daughter.",4.9

John drops off Regina at the airport. When he is about to leave the airport, he gets a call from Regina, who tells him that she saw Surya at the immigration counter.

Surya says that he is now happily married and tells John that one cannot always marry the girl he loves, but should always love the girl he marries. As he leaves, he glances at the ring in his hand, which was gifted to him by Regina, showing that Surya will always live with the memories of their relationship.
Regina, who is terribly angry, slaps John as she never wanted to get back with Surya, as that was the past. Regina throws the gift that John never opened.

Jose discovers that his deceased father had run bankrupt with an unlisted property in Pondicherry. To pay off the debts, he makes a visit to the villa for valuation. But after seeing framed paintings by his father, he calls his girlfriend Aarthi, who is an art student, to accompany him to the villa. She immediately likes both the villa and the mysterious paintings. She particularly shows interest in one dual faced painting.
Aarthi urges Jebin not to sell the villa. Within a few days time, Jebin's career gets a new break when an established publisher comes forward to buy rights for his first novel Maybe, Maybe Not!. He also gets advance ₹500,000 (US$7,700) in a two-book contract. Seeing this as a sign, Jebin continues to stay at the villa in hopes it will bring him good luck while starting to work on his second novel The Director. Meanwhile, Aarthi returns to Chennai to seek permission from her father for their marriage, leaving Jebin alone in the villa.
One night, an ecstatic Jebin plays the Victorian piano. The strings get jammed abruptly. He opens the lid and finds a secret key underneath. Jebin also gets curious on the remarkable geometry of one of the paintings which appears to be more like a map than a work of art. He notices that it is similar to the floor plan of the villa given to him by his lawyer. As he probes each room in the villa, he stumbles upon a secret door behind a wardrobe. He uses the secret key to open the lock and discovers plenty of paintings rolled up inside a trunk. Many scenes appear to have come straight out of his own life, like his mother's death by car accident. Jebin slowly realises that his father had precognition skills and concludes that his paintings may predict future events.
Not too long after that, Jebin wins a prestigious literary award and critical acclaim for his debut novel, as depicted in one of his father's paintings. However, he gets overwhelmed by this unexplained occurrence and tries to sell off the villa. During the process, the estate agent gets injured in a freak accident by the cast-iron gate, scaring away potential buyers who view this as a bad omen. Frustrated, Jebin furiously tries to complete his second novel. When Aarthi returns from Chennai, Jebin tells her about his discovery. They decide to burn all the paintings in the secret room. But almost instinctively, the secret room defends itself by toppling furniture and fittings to block their entry.
Jebin's best friend advises him to consult a renowned parapsychologist, Devanesan to find a solution. Devanesan conjectures that the villa may have the left-over negative energy of prior owners as symptoms manifest psychic phenomena. Jebin also finds the identities and whereabouts of prior owners. But all report similar grim events in their lives like infanticide, lunacy, fratricide, disease, insolvency, death, et al. Devanesan also suggests that Jebin's father may have found an outlet, in his passion for paintings, to survive this negative energy which can neither be created nor destroyed but only transferred. He then begins to conduct more experiments using a tuning fork within the villa compound. But all hell break loose midway and apparitions begin to appear. In the chaos, Jebin's best friend loses his legs. Jebin even finds some paintings depicting a man and a woman getting married, and the man eventually killing the woman. Assuming that his father predicted that he would end up killing Aarthi, Jebin sets fire to himself and the villa to prevent him from harming the girl he loves.
When Aarthi sees that Jebin has taken his own life before legally marrying her, she realises she has no claim over his estate. It is then revealed that Aarthi's true intentions were indicated by the dual faced painting she liked when she visited the villa. She had hoped to secure the money Jebin would gain from his book sale and selling the villa. With Jebin dead, Aarthi quickly seduces and marries an up and coming movie director.
However, it is revealed that Aarthi's killer in the painting that Jebin assumed was him is actually Aarthi's new husband, the movie director. Thus, it can be understood that Jebin did not realise that he too inherited his father's gift, with his second novel depicting that a ""director"" character would soon appear in the prophecy.",6.6

Neason,"Mohanlal, Vijay, Kajal Aggarwal, Mahat, Niveda Thomas",action-masala,"Sakthi (Vijay) is the adopted son of a Madurai-based don Sivan (Mohanlal) and is also his right-hand man, bodyguard and driver. He hates the police due to a police officer killing his father, who was Sivan's driver, in his childhood. His hatred is such that he hates the khaki colour (which is worn by policemen in India), constantly teases his friend Gopal (Soori), who is a sub-inspector, and even loses romantic interest on a woman named Shanthi (Kajal Aggarwal) after he finds out that she is a police inspector. However, when Sivan is insulted by the new Police Commissioner of Madurai (Pradeep Rawat), he forces Sakthi to become an IPS officer to save his crime syndicate and prove the Commissioner's words wrong (A policeman can think like a criminal, but a criminal can never think like a policeman). Reluctantly taking charge as Assistant Commissioner of Police of Madurai city, Sakthi gives free rein to Sivan and his henchmen, who wreak havoc over Madurai, until one of their activities inadvertently causes a gas leak which destroys a school and some nearby buildings, killing several people, including women and children. This incident, along with the assault of a woman (Meenal), whose husband was killed in the gas leak, by Sivan's henchmen when she had come to the police station to lodge a complaint against Sivan, causes Sakthi to take up the path of an honest and upright police officer. Sakthi's new persona is not liked by Sivan and after a heated argument between the two, he disowns Sakthi. A cat-and-mouse game then begins between Sivan and Sakthi, with Sivan, his henchmen and his family determined to humiliate Sakthi at every opportunity, while Sakthi, assisted by Shanthi and Gopal, tries to rid Madurai of Sivan's influence. Sakthi is soon promoted to Deputy Commissioner of Police for his efforts.
Later, Sakthi finds out that Sivan's other adopted son, a minister Aadhi Kesavan (Sampath Raj) is plotting to kill Sivan in revenge for Sivan killing his police officer father (the same police officer who killed Sakthi's father) in his childhood. Since Sakthi had inadvertently thwarted his earlier plans to kill Sivan, he also plans to get Sakthi killed at the hands of Sivan by killing Sivan's son Vignesh (Mahat Raghavendra) and putting the blame on Sakthi for Vignesh's death. Unfortunately for Aadhi, Sivan sees through his plan and reconciles with Sakthi, both of whom team up to kill Aadhi.
In the end, Sakthi reluctantly arrests a reformed Sivan for his misdeeds, on Sivan's request.",6

2014,Pannaiyarum Padminiyum,Tamil,Arun Kumar,"Vijay Sethupathi, Iyshwarya Rajesh, Jayaprakash",comedy-drama,"The movie begins with a young man (Attakathi Dinesh) buying a car and he says that his inspiration is from a Pannaiyar (landlord) in his village and his love for a vintage Fiat PAL Premier Padmini car.
Pannaiyar (Jayaprakash) is a wealthy and respectable man in his village. Pannaiyar and his wife Chellamma(Thulasi) are kindhearted and broadminded people who are responsible for introducing essential modern technology like Television, Radio, telephone,etc., to their villagers. The villagers also enjoy the liberty of using all these items with his permission. The couple have a married daughter Suja(Neelima Rani), who is greedy and whenever she visits her parents, she makes it a point to return to her house with whichever device she finds pleasing to her eye.
Pannaiyar visits his close friend Shanmugam(Mahadevan), who owns the then latest (now vintage) Fiat PAL Premier Padmini car. Pannaiyar is smitten by the beauty of the car and becomes an ardent admirer. He enjoys the ride like an excited kid. Soon, Shanmugam also comes to his house and to Pannaiyar's surprise and happiness, says that he will leave the car for a couple of months under Pannaiyar's care since he is going to visit his pregnant daughter. Pannaiyar happily agrees and from then on, he stands in front of car dusting it and admiring it for hours at a time. Since he doesn't know to drive, he appoints a local young man Murugesan (Vijay Sethupathi) as driver and the comical household servant Peedai(Bala Saravanan) as the cleaner. Pannaiyar and Chellamma treat them like their own sons. School going kids often swarm around the car asking for a ride in the front seat and one little boy in particular is very much interested, so Peedai jokingly asks him to bring five rupees to get a front seat ride and the boy starts saving his pocket money sincerely day by day. Like all the other facilities belonging to Pannaiyar, the villagers also get the opportunities to use the car for their emergency purposes. On one such day, when Murugesan is helping a family at a funeral, he comes across a beautiful girl Malarvizhi(Aishwarya Rajesh) among the mourners. He is attracted to her instantly and after a bit of pursuing, she also falls for him and they start to love each other.
As days pass by, Panniyar, Chellamma and Murugesan become more and more attached to the car and are dreading to part with it if at all Shanmugam comes to take it someday. Chellamma is the sensible person out of the three, so she distances herself and on one occasion she refuses to even get in the car and when Pannaiyar asks why, she replies that she will get into the car only on the day when Pannaiyar drives it. So Pannaiyar is determined to learn driving and asks Murugesan to train him. Murugesan fears that he will have no job with the car if Pannaiyar starts driving, so he delays and procrastinates as much as he can. So Pannaiyar's driving progress is very slow. One night, Chellamma requests her husband to learn driving before their wedding anniversary so that they can go to the temple together and he obliges.
Meanwhile, Shanmugam's daughter (Sneha) unexpectedly visits them and says that her dad suddenly died and requests him to give some property documents that her father left under his care. Pannaiyar is shocked to hear about the loss of his friend, at the same time he feels sad to part with the car. But when he is about to hand over the keys and documents, she says that let the car remain with him as a remembrance of her dad and she leaves it behind. Pannaiyar, Chellamma and Murugesan are overjoyed to hear this and gift her with money as a blessing. Now that they are the proud owners of the car, the Pannaiyar family is content and certain heartwarming incidents also change Murugesan's mind and now he wholeheartedly plans to train Pannaiyar to drive. One small accident happens while training and due to rough handling, the car starts to have minor glitches and starting troubles from then on.
One day, Pannaiyar's daughter Suja comes home and when she sees they have bought the car, she fights with her parents and says that a third person like Murugesan is using the car for driving around his girlfriend and demands that she wants to take it to her house. Unable to refuse, Pannaiyar halfheartedly lets her take it, much to the disappointment of Murugesan and Chellamma and Pannaiyar also feels bad that now their wedding anniversary plans are also ruined because of that. But exactly on their wedding day, as the family is preparing to get into a bullock cart to go to the temple, they see an irate Suja coming to their house with the villagers pushing the car back into their house. She says that she and her husband just missed death by inches in an accident because the car suddenly stopped and scolds her father for giving a useless old car. Chellamma steps in and scolds her and Suja storms away angrily leaving the car behind. Murugesan, Pannaiyar and Chellamma dismiss Suja's unnecessary tantrum and are rather pleased that their car is back. They try to start the car but unfortunately it wouldn't start. In utter frustration, Peedai jumps over the car and sits on the bonnet and suddenly it starts.
Finally, as per their earlier plan, Pannaiyar manages to drive successfully and take his wife Chellamma in his own car to the temple on their anniversary. Meanwhile, the little boy who saved money to get a front seat ride sadly leaves out of town for higher studies without his wish being fulfilled. That boy now turns out to be the young man (Attakathi Dinesh) who bought the new car at the beginning of the movie. He visits his hometown and still searches for the car in Pannaiyar's house. He sees Murugesan, Pannaiyar and Peedai using the very same vintage car even now and even using the same method of Peedai jumping over the bonnet to start it. Murugesan is now married to Malarvizhi and has kids. The young man is still awestruck by the car like a kid, and Murugesan asks if he needs a ride to the town. He says yes and finally sits in the front seat of the car, and his longtime wish is fulfilled at last as they drive away.",4.7

The scene then shifts a few months back.
Enter Kathirvelan aka Kathir (Udhayanidhi Stalin), a Madurai-based minibus owner who is a devout Hindu and devotee of Lord Anjaneya since the age of five. Due to his devotion for Lord Maruti, he does not show any interest in women.
One day, while returning from a Sri Anjaneya temple, he sees his elder sister, Vineethra (Chaya Singh) crying outside his house after his father (Aadukalam Naren) refused to take her in, having disowned her for eloping with a Coimbatore-based mill owner Shanmugham (Dr. Bharath Reddy) against his wishes. Vineethra, however, now has issues with Shanmugham, as a result of which, she left him and returned to her father's house. On Kathir's cajoling, his father reluctantly accepts Vineethra into the house. Kathir then decides to find out what caused the standoff between Vineethra and Shanmugham and leaves for Coimbatore, lying to his father that he is headed for Salem to do some work related to his minibus business. Before leaving, he is warned by Vineethra not to fall for Shanmugham's neighbor, Pavithra (Nayanthara), as her father and Shanmugham are sworn enemies.
In Coimbatore, Kathir successfully manages to resolve the conflict between Vineethra and Shanmugham, with Vineethra returning to Coimbatore eventually. He, however, does not return to Madurai immediately, staying back in Coimbatore after noticing Pavithra and falling in love with her, despite Vineethra's warning and his devotion to Lord Bajrangbali. Determined to win Pavithra's heart, he takes the help of his college friend Mayilvaganam aka Mayil (Santhanam), who is a medical doctor, finds out that Pavithra is working as a manager in a Panasonic showroom. The duo go there so that Kathir can speak to Pavithra, but end up creating a scene, forcing Pavithra to throw both of them out. After Pavithra notices Kathir constantly following her, she confronts him and threatens to take him to the police, which increases the friction between them. However, when Pavithra finds out how Kathir had saved Vineethra's marriage, she forgives him and becomes his friend, but later reveals that she is in love with a businessman, Gautham (Sunder Ramu), which breaks Kathir's heart. To add to Kathir's woes, Shanmugham finds out that he is in love with Pavithra, and kicks him out of his house for showing interest in his enemy's daughter. Meanwhile, back in Madurai, his father too disowns him after finding out that he had not gone to Salem after all. Without a place to stay now, Kathir moves into Mayil's home.
Kathir soon finds out that Pavithra's boyfriend Gautham is a womanizer, planning to dump Pavithra after having a one night stand with her at his friend's upcoming marriage in Ooty. He tells her about this, but she rubbishes his claims and admonishes him for still hitting on her. However, she soon realizes the truth about Gautham after he attempts to kiss her in his car causing her to dump him. She and Kathir reconcile, but she now realizes that she has feelings for Kathir. With the help of Mayil and Pavithra's Malayali friend (Kala Kalyani), who Mayil has fallen in love with, they soon express their feelings for one another.
Trouble soon erupts however, after Shanmugham and Pavithra's father find out that Kathir and Pavithra are in love. Kathir and Pavithra decide that the only way Shanmugham and Pavithra's father can accept their relationship is to make them reconcile, as it is revealed by Shanmugham, that he and Pavithra's father are sworn enemies due to the enmity which existed between the latter and Shanmugham's deceased father, who happened to be Pavithra's paternal uncle. They take the help of a mimicry artist, Balaraman (Mayilsamy), who mimics both Shanmugham's and Pavithra's father's voices in the presence of the real Pavithra's father and Shanmugham respectively, which eventually leads to Shanmugham and Pavithra's father reconciling.
With the initial hurdle cleared, Kathir and Mayil then plan to convince Kathir's father, who has now reconciled with Kathir, but is also searching for a bride for him, to allow Kathir to marry Pavithra. However, while trying to tell Kathir's father about Pavithra, Mayil consumes poison and is immediately rushed to the hospital, which it is later revealed that Mayil pretended to poison himself by pretending to swallow laxatives, fearing the wrath of Kathir's father, and thereby revealing the identity of the person in the prologue. On returning home, Kathir tells his father about Pavithra, who, as expected, becomes furious and locks himself up in his room. Later, Kathir manages to calm down his father and adds that he will not marry Pavithra as long as he refuses to accept their relationship, whilst also saying that, unlike Vineethra, he does not want to marry without seeking his father's permission. On hearing of this, his father forgives Kathir, accepts his relationship with Pavithra and gives the go ahead signal for their marriage.
The film ends with Kathir and Pavithra getting married happily.",6.6

She confronts Shakthi, who quickly summons his friend, the videographer at the wedding, and pretends that he is part of the film crew and has a right to be there. After seeing her dance at the wedding, Shakthi cannot resist the temptation to make a video of Shruti doing her dance routine.
The next day, Shakthi calls those involved in the wedding and manages to get Shruti's name and her college. He then chases her down on her bus ride home and tries to impress her with a DVD of her dance routine at the wedding. Shruti is not interested in Shakthi and reveals that her aim in life is starting her own wedding planning business by the name 'Getti Melam'. Shakthi's enthusiasm for courtship is quickly dampened once Shruti launches a long pitch of her business ideas.
Shakthi, meanwhile is under pressure from his parents to come back to their village and work in their sugarcane fields, and Shruti is being coaxed by her family to get married at the earliest. But Shruti makes a deal with her parents that after her exams, she will take five years to get her business running before getting married. When Shakthi's father comes to take him back to his village, Shakthi refuses and lies that he is starting a wedding planning business. He now goes back to Shruti who refuses him as she is worried that romantic complications would arise. Shakthi promises that it will never be a problem, but Shruti is not interested.
Shruti goes to meet with Chandralekha (Simran), a famous wedding planner, with Shakthi tagging along. She hopes that she will be hired and get the opportunity to learn about planning ""high-class weddings"". Chandra shows no interest, but by sheer coincidence loses one of her male workers at that moment. Short on time, she spots Shakthi next to Shruti, and offers him the job. Shakthi accepts on the condition that both he and Shruti are hired together. While checking the arrangements, Shruti learns that Chandra is cheating her clients by ordering cheap arrangements of flowers and decorations so she can earn more commission. Later, when an irate bride's father confronts Chandra, she blames Shruti, claiming it was her fault.

They quit and Shruti, calling him her partner, leaves with him, warning Chandra that they will cross paths.

That night, after the event, they dance to celebrate and both end up slightly drunk. A simple hug turns into more, and the two make love that night. Afterwards, Shakthi lies awake all night, worried about what has happened.
When Shruti starts calling him ""dear"" in the morning, he is obviously uncomfortable with it. Not wanting to hurt her feelings, Shakthi behaves awkwardly around her over the next few days, while Shruti realizes that she has fallen in love with him. Shruti tries to reassure Shakthi that she's not like other women he's been with who follow him around everywhere. Shakthi, misunderstanding, believes that she's telling him that the night didn't mean anything to her. Relieved, he tells her it meant nothing to him as well. Shruti pretends to agree but cries after he leaves. This creates a tense atmosphere between the two. They have a huge fight resulting in Shruti breaking the partnership and forcing Shakthi to leave the company. Shakthi vows to start his own wedding planning business and the two go their separate ways. However, they don't do as well by themselves, unable to handle the workload without their partner and both enterprises end up suffering huge losses, plunging them into debt.
They finally get a big contract, but it is contingent upon them working together as a team. The bride had been a guest at the first big wedding they'd done and wanted the same level for her own wedding. Facing creditors, they agree to partner up again for this one wedding for the sake of recovering their own losses. They divvy up the workload and each focuses on their own departments. Shakthi and Shruti perform together for the wedding. The performance is a success and the following day, Shakthi tells Shruti that they should be partners again, saying that Getti Melam was never as successful as when they were together. Shruti refuses his offer, telling him that she is getting married in two months to her fiancé, Siddharth, and will move to Dubai with him after the wedding. Shakthi is stunned and immediately argues with her that she can't get married, saying it is ""totally wrong"".
During the rest of the wedding preparations Shakthi pesters Shruti about her engagement, claiming that she'd be moving too far from her parents or that Dubai wouldn't suit her. When none of those reason dissuade her, Shakthi accuses her of her getting married to make him jealous, claiming that she'd fallen in love with him and that this was a way to get revenge because he paid her no heed after their night together. Shruti answers that she is not doing it for revenge, but for her own security and her parents' satisfaction to see her settled in life. She admits that she did fall in love with Shakthi, but since he didn't feel the same, she had moved on. Shruti answers a call from Siddharth and walks away sadly, leaving Shakthi alone.
At the sudden thought of losing her forever, Shakthi realizes that he has always been in love with Shruti, but was too scared to acknowledge it in fear of jeopardizing the business. Desperate to win her back, Shakthi steals Siddharth's phone number from Shruti's cell and calls him, telling him to back off and that Shruti is his. Hearing what Shakthi had done to Siddharth, Shruti angrily runs off to find Shakthi and confronts him where he is waiting for her on a rooftop. Shakthi tells Shruti that he'd loved her all along and was a fool to have run away from her love. Shruti calls off her engagement and the two share a passionate hug.",5.5

Sandy, who is sceptical about the siddhar's powers, asks him for a copy of the Daily Thanthi newspaper dated on the day after Ayudha Puja (no newspapers are printed during Ayudha Puja). To his surprise, the siddhar materialises the requested copy. The IT gang read the materialised newspaper and find out to their shock that the company which they work for (Satyam Computers) would close down the next day.

Eventually, Peter enters the final of the tournament, where he is to face ""Killer"" Peter. He becomes upset at this development, fearing that he might be killed by ""Killer"" Peter and revealing to Yazhini that he is not a boxer . He tries to avoid fighting in the final through various means, none of which are successful. In a last-ditch attempt, he tries to convince ""Killer"" Peter to ""throw"" the match so that he could win and impress Yazhini, but is verbally abused and physically assaulted by him in response.

Back home, Indhiran stares at his wishlist and recalls his past.
Since childhood, Indhiran has been suffering from narcolepsy, a rare disorder, which makes him fall asleep whenever his emotions reach an extreme and hinders him from living an ordinary life. He needs to be accompanied all the time, companies hesitate to hire him, although he has excelled in academics, and he cannot impregnate women since he would fall asleep during sex. However, he can still hear whatever is being said when he is sleeping.
Indhiran creates a list with 10 goals he wants to achieve on his own. One day, he ventures out alone, which was one of his goals. When he is almost hit by a vehicle while crossing the road, his fear mounts and he falls asleep in the middle of the road.

She later meets Indhiran in a mall and falls unconscious, seeing him alive. After clearing up the misunderstanding, they start dating and fall for each other.Meera makes one of the dreams of Indhiran come true (i.e.)getting a kiss from a beautiful woman by kissing him. But Meera's father opposes their marriage as Indhiran cannot give birth to a child. Meera urges Indhiran to find a way how he could stay awake. It dawns on Indhiran that he had never fallen asleep while taking a shower. Believing that her father will accept Indhiran only when his potency is proved, Meera and Indhiran have sex underwater in their pool, resulting in Meera becoming pregnant.

Enquiring Meera's friends, Indhiran first suspects Karthik (Rishi), a rich but ill-mannered guy, whose marriage proposal was rejected by Meera. Indhiran confronts him, but he feigns ignorance about the incident.
Indhiran remembers that it were four persons, with one of them named Sekhar, and Sekhar's ringtone, while the police finds out that the offenders rode a red car. Indhiran stumbles upon a red car in a petrol bunk and enquires the driver who claims that the car was with a mechanic named Sekhar on the day the crime took place. At the workshop, he spots the mechanic who tries to abscond, recognising Indhiran, and a chase ensues leading them to a building under construction. Informed by Sathish, Karuna arrives there and kills Sekhar. He then slits himself and is admitted for treatment. Karuna then recollects.
Married to Karuna for two years, Kavitha (Iniya) was dissatisfied with her drunkard husband; she begins an affair with Aravind, a rich friend of Karuna. He spends a lot of money on buying her expensive gifts. Indhiran gains knowledge of this and advises Kavitha against it. It turns out that Karuna, to realise his ambitions of running a business in US, had been using his wife to manipulate Aravind. Citing Indhiran's confrontation, Kavitha bluffed to Aravind that if Karuna gets to know about the affair, he would kill them both. She suggested that the only way to solve it once and for all is to arrange the amount of ₹ 20 million Karuna needs to settle in the states. With him gone, they could enjoy being together. Aravind agreed to finance Karuna out of his lust for her.
Later, when Karuna and Kavitha are celebrating their success, Indhiran drops by unexpectedly. They mess up; Indhiran suspects them and informs Aravind who confronts the couple. When Aravind realizes that he had been cheated, he hits Kavitha in a fit of rage and she dies. Infuriated, Karuna retaliated and kills Aravind. Karuna arranges for disposing them with the help of the thugs and lies to Indhiran that Kavitha has eloped with Aravind. Since he assumed that Indhiran was responsible for the death of Kavitha, Karuna had planned to take revenge by making him suffer the same way and requested the thugs to rape Indhiran's girlfriend, Meera.
The remaining thugs insist Karuna to bring Indhiran to the same place where Sekhar was killed. Finding out that it was Karuna who had killed Sekhar, they beat him up.

They are warmly welcomed by General Wang (Wilson Ng) and courtesan Hong (Vivienne Tseng) once they reach there. The Chinese consulate, headed by Chao Gong Gong (Nickson Cheng), wishes to engage in trade with the people of the Kingdom of Vikata Nagaram and reap the benefits. Thus, the ministers strike a deal with Parasbaram and the ministers to help them, promising them a huge share of the benefits. The Foreign Affairs Minister of Vikata Nagaram, Nandivarma Rayar (Joe Malloori) objects to this, saying that he doesn't want to betray the King and his people for money. Chao Gong Gong realising that he is of no use to the plan, has courtesan Hong kill him with a poisoned needle from her hair.
The film then introduces Tenaliraman (Vadivelu as the witty common man) who captures a gang of thieves (led by ""Besant Nagar"" Ravi) and teaches them a lesson. He then takes off for Vikata Nagaram where he meets the feisty Princess Maadhulai (Meenakshi Dixit), daughter of the King of Vikata Nagaram, and defeats her in an arm wrestling competition.
The film's plot then shifts to the King (Vadivelu again, as the King of Vikata Nagaram), who is ruling over his kingdom along with his nine ministers, whom he claims to be the Navarathnams (nine jewels) of his court. The most interesting aspect is that the King has a rather large family comprising 36 wives and 52 children and is confined mostly to his palace. He believes his people are happy based on the sayings and reports of his ministers. In reality, the people are being robbed and cheated by the corrupt ministers and are living in poverty. During his administration, he realizes the absence of Nandivarma Rayar and asks about it to his ministers, who reply that he had died. The King then declares that a new minister be appointed in Nandivarma Rayar's stead. The guards then announce the news in public. Tenaliraman overhears the news and goes to the palace as a candidate for Nandivarma Rayar's post.
After a display of his all-round talents (singing, dancing, wit and humour), Tenaliraman impresses the King and soon becomes the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and an integral part of the King's court, even closer to the King than the presiding ones. In the meantime, love blossoms between Tenaliraman and Princess Maadhulai. Tenaliraman, in reality, is a rebel who is sent by his comrades to kill the King, whom he believes at first, is responsible for the poverty of the people. Later, while having dinner with the King and the ministers, he discovers that it is the ministers who are at fault and not the King. He tries to warn his comrades of this, but his pigeon who carried the warning message, is captured by one of the ministers (Manobala). He informs the other ministers that Tenaliraman is a rebel and they twist Tenaliraman's message to the rebels, saying that the King will be killed that night. Tenaliraman's comrades believe the twisted message sent to them and raid the palace, only to have them and Tenaliraman get captured by the King. On learning of the conspiracy, the King banishes Tenaliraman from his kingdom.
After a few months, many changes have taken place in Vikata Nagaram. The Chinese have entered the fray and are trading with the Kingdom. Unbeknownst to the King, they are reaping the rewards for themselves, leaving the people even poorer. Parasbaram and the ministers get their share and are enjoying themselves. The King is now very sad thinking of Tenaliraman and misses him. Princess Maadhulai then tells him that Tenaliraman could not have done such a thing and comforts her father. He learns from Tenaliraman's comrade, Kaaliappa (Bose Venkat) that the rebels were wrongly informed and that Tenaliraman was not at fault. The King goes and successfully brings back Tenaliraman to his Kingdom.
Tenaliraman then informs the King in private, that all the rules and regulations and schemes organised by the King on the trade with the Chinese are being carried out in such a way that it only benefits the Chinese and the ministers and not the people, who live in utter poverty, and since the King confines himself mostly to his palace and believes the words of his ministers and that he has lived a rich and prosperous life all along, he cannot mingle and live with the people of his Kingdom even for one day. The King then bets Tenaliraman that he can live with his people incognito for 10 days, and at the same time, find concrete evidence that the people are being robbed and cheated by the Chinese and the ministers. Leaving the care of his Kingdom to Tenaliraman and lying to his wives that he will be going to a nearby Kingdom for administrative purposes and for attending a feast, the King begins his mission.
During his mission, the King learns about the plight of his people from various persons. Soon, he comically finds himself in a hunger strike that is organised against him. When Tenaliraman meets the King in private and converses with him, one of the citizens (Devadarshini) overhears the conversation and discovers that it is the King himself who is among them incognito and reveals it to the citizens of Vikata Nagaram.
In the meantime, Tenaliraman is ruling in the King's state with an Iron grip and because of this, Chao Gong Gong and Parasbaram fear that they might get caught in the process. Parasbaram learns from his spies that the King is in Vikata Nagaram and not elsewhere. He reveals it to Chao Gong Gong and they issue orders to find the King and kill him.
The King, with his citizens, have started a riot in Vikata Nagaram, but unfortunately, the King is captured by the Chinese. Parasbaram, who wanted the throne of Vikata Nagaram for himself, purposefully does not divulge to the Chinese that the King was among those captured until the corrupt ministers came to the consulate to say that the King is in Vikata Nagaram. The King revealed himself and everyone are dumb founded. Chao Gong Gong orders courtesan Hong to kill Parasbarm, because he purposefully failed to realise earlier that the person they caught was the King. The King is then imprisoned in a carriage and taken to a secluded place to be executed. But the leader of a Cannibal tribe stops them midway and orders the King to be handed over to them. Surrounded by Cannibals, Chao Gong Gong reluctantly releases the King. The King, initially frightened, asks the Cannibal who he is. The Cannibal is revealed to be none other than Tenaliraman. Chao Gong Gong uses his telescope and spots something fishy and the ministers and the Chinese traders find out, after General Wang fired at the ""men"" on the hilltop, that the ""men"" were just haystacks and that they have been duped. They then to go after the pair, but Tenaliraman, in his style, chases them out of Vikata Nagaram forever using the same bag of tricks that he used on the gang of thieves earlier.
The film then ends with new people replacing the posts of the corrupt ministers. Tenaliraman becomes the new prime minister. Coincidentally, most of these new people were involved in comical encounters with the King during his 10-day plan. In the end, the King selects a post for himself, on Tenaliraman's suggestion, as the child welfare minister and Princess Maadhulai is selected as the extra curricular activities minister.
The film signs off with the tagline ""Tenaliraman Amaitha Indha Makkal Aatchi Thodarattum.....Dum!"".",5.3

The film begins with RJ Balaji (playing himself), coming to Panimalai to be a guest of a live radio show. In the middle of the show, he starts coughing severely and suddenly loses his voice. He is diagnosed with a new type of virus called the Mute flu, that causes sudden muteness and sometimes even death.
Aravindh (Dulquer Salman) is a Sales Rep working with a glue company. His dream is to become a Radio Jockey, and even attends interviews with a FM station. As the Mute Flu spreads across the city, the state Government sends the Health Minister Sundaralingam (Pandiarajan) to Panimalai to take care of the situation. The people are asked to undergo a medical checkup to check whether they are affected by the virus or not. Aravindh goes to the hospital and meets Anjana (Nazriya Nazim), a junior doctor, who believes that talking is the only cause of all the problems in the world and if people keep things to themselves things will be very fine. Anjana is in a relationship with Vinodh, a possessive guy who always commands Anjana on what she should do and even what she should wear. Anjana lives with her Dad and Stepmom Vidhya (Madhoo). Since Anjana lost her mom at a young age, she is reluctant to accept Vidhya as her mom, though she is a sweet and caring woman, and always maintains a distance from her. Vidhya is an aspiring writer, who is trying to get her Husband's attention and support to write her third book. Her husband finds no time to talk to her as he is too busy with his work.
Panimalai comes into the news for another issue, where, Bhoomesh (John Vijay), a film superstar, who has gone to shoot one of his films, is being opposed by Mattai Ravi (Robo Shankar), a drunkard who is the President of the Drinkers Association, over the issue of Bhoomesh showing drunkards in a bad light in his films. The Drinkers Association and Bhoomesh's fans, led by (Ramesh Thilak) form groups to fight over this issue.
Aravindh and Anjana begin a friendship and he insists her that if everything is spoken directly from the heart, there would be no problem between anyone. He asks her to speak openly with Vinodh and sort out the difference of opinion between them. She does not agree to this, and Aravindh challenges her that, if he successfully stops the feud between Bhoomesh and Mattai Ravi just by means of speaking, Anjana should talk openly with Vinodh to sort out their issues. They both agree on the challenge and mark a deadline day. Aravindh tries so many ways to stop the feud between Bhoomesh's fans and the Drinkers association, but it ends up in an even bitter fight. As time goes by, Aravindh falls in love with Anjana, not knowing that she is engaged to Vinodh.
Aravindh is brought up in an Orphanage that belongs to Adhikesavan (Vinu Chakravarthy), a stubborn old man, who is constantly asking the Orphanage to be vacated so that he can rent it to richer tenants. Though Aravindh helps the Children in the Orphanage by donating some of his money, it is not enough to save the Orphanage. Aravindh tries to speak to him and sort the issue, but Adhikesavan is too hesitant even to speak with him.
But Aravindh and his friend kidnap the stubborn man and leave him in his son's house making a close relationship.
The final report by the health organisation says that the dumb flu spreads only by means of speaking, and issues a speaking ban in the town. Then everyone in the town tries to adjust to living with not speaking. Aravindh conducts the meeting with Drinkers Association and Bhoomesh's fans and they reconcile.
A cure for the illness is invented, but if the virus has already infected but has not removed the voice of a person, the cure has a 50% probability of a side effect that the patient might lose the ability to speak. The movie ends with everyone getting cured but minister Sundaralingam, who has been faking the illness being given cure medicine on the stage for a photo op and losing his voice for real.",8.1

The boy soon meets with an accident while rowing in the river and is eventually discovered by some fishermen from the neighbouring kingdom of Kalingapuri, a rival of Kottaipattinam. Rana (Rajinikanth) grows up there and trains in weaponry, and grows up to be a fearless warrior. Due to his fighting skills and bravery, he soon wins the confidence of the king of Kalingapuri, Raja Mahendran (Jackie Shroff), who promotes him as Commander-in-Chief of the Kalingapuri army. The son of Raja Mahendran, Veera Mahendran (Aadhi) shows Rana around the kingdom's mine where the captured soldiers of Kottaipattinam work as slaves. Veera says that this information is known only to a few people. After this, Rana promotes a war strategy to Veera that they release the slaves and have them trained in the army of Kalingapuri. Veera agrees and the slaves are freed. He then gets Raja Mahendran's approval to attack Kottaipattinam. However, during the war, Rana encounters his childhood friend, crown prince Sengodagan (R. Sarathkumar), the son of Rishikodagan (Nassar), king of Kottaipattinam. Instead of fighting, it is revealed that the main motive of Rana's plan was to free the soldiers of Kottipattinam. Immediately signaling an end to the war, he, along with the soldiers disown Kalingapuri and return to Kottaipattinam, much to the disgust of Raja Mahendran and his son, crown prince Veera Mahendran , who swear revenge on Rana for tricking them and betraying Kalingapuri.
At Kottaipattinam, Rana and Sengodagan renew their friendship. Sengodagan introduces Rana to Rishikodagan, who is alarmed on seeing him. Rana also reunites with his younger sister Yamuna Devi (Rukmini Vijayakumar) whom he last saw as a baby and their uncle (Nagesh), who raised her, but soon learns that his mother Yaaghavi (Shobana) is dead and his brother Sena is missing. He soon learns that Yamuna and Sengodagan are in love with each other. He accepts their relationship and decides to get them married, even cleverly convincing Rishikodagan, who was unwilling to get his son married to a commoner like Yamuna. Meanwhile, Rana also falls in love with his childhood sweetheart, princess Vadhana Devi (Deepika Padukone), the daughter of Rishikodagan.
Soon, Sengodagan and Yamuna get married. But following the wedding, Rishikodagan disowns his son for marrying Yamuna despite knowing that the latter does not belong to a royal family. An unfazed Sengodagan immediately leaves the palace with Yamuna. Later that night, a masked man barges into the palace and attempts to kill Rishikodagan. Vadhana immediately goes after him, fights him and gets him captured. Rishikodagan unmasks the assassin who is revealed to be Rana, and immediately throws him into prison, sentencing him to death. An upset Vadhana rushes to the cell where Rana is imprisoned, where Rana tells her why he attempted to kill Rishikodagan.
Years ago, Rana is the younger son of Kochadaiiyaan, the former Commander-in-Chief of Kottaipattinam's army. Kochadaiiyaan is extremely respected in Kottaipattinam for his bravery and is more popular than Rishikodagan himself. So, Rishikodagan jealous of Kochadaiiyaan. One night, when Kochadaiiyaan is returning by ship to Kottaipatinam with his army after buying horses and ammunition, they are attacked by the rival army of Kalingapuri. Kochadaiiyaan defeats them but allows them to return to their kingdom as an act of chivalry. However, the Kalingapuri army, before leaving, poison the food on the ship. The Kottaipattinam army men consume this food, and fall ill.
Despite knowing that he had been tricked by the Kalingapuri army, Kochadaiiyaan immediately rushes to Kalingapuri itself, because it is the only land body close enough to provide medicines to the sick and dying soldiers. He orders Raja Mahendran to provide medical assistance to his soldiers. Raja Mahendran, in turn, cunningly proposes a deal that, if he wants his men to be saved, he has to leave all the horses, ammunition and the sick army men in Kalingapuri as slaves. Only if Kochadaiiyan agrees to this, his soldiers will be nursed back to health. Kochadaiiyan thinks that his men rather be alive as slaves than die from poisoning, and also thinks that when they officially wage a war in the near future, all of them could be easily rescued. So he accepts Raja Mahendran's offer and leaves Kalingapuri all alone. When he returns to Kottaipattinam, the jealous Rishikodagan seizes this opportunity to strip Kochadaiiyan off all respect and dignity and sentences him to death for becoming a traitor to Kottaipattinam by surrendering his army men, horses and ammunition to Kalingapuri. Though all his subjects are dismayed at Kochadaiiyaan being sentenced to death, and his wife Yaaghavi even goes to the extent of publicly rebuking Rishikodagan for his injustice, Rishikodagan stands firm in his decision. Kochadaiiyaan is executed the following morning before Rana's eyes.
The story comes back to the present, with Rana telling Vadhana that he ran away to Kalingapuri, with the intention of freeing the soldiers of Kottaipattinam and to take revenge on Rishikodagan for unjustly killing his father. Vadhana is shocked on hearing about her father's actions and reconciles with Rana. She then pleads with her father to release Rana, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Rana escapes from the prison. When Rishikodagan learns of Rana's escape, he immediately arranges for Vadhana's marriage with prince Veera Mahendran after consulting with an astrologer and learning that his life is at Rana's mercy. Despite the enmity between Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri, he arranges this marriage with the hope that their united armies and their mutual hatred for Rana can subdue him.
On the day of the marriage, Rana arrives just when the marriage is about to take place. He and the people of Kottapattinam berate Rishikodagan for becoming a traitor and surrendering the whole kingdom of Kottaipattinam to Raja Mahendran for his own personal interests and commitments, which was the same charge that Rishikodagan had placed on Kochadaiiyaan years ago. Following this, a war starts between Rana and the united armies of Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri. Rana successfully manages to subdue the armies of both kingdoms and along with a majority of Kottaipattinam's army, he kills Raja Mahendran and allows Veera Mahendran to return as he was defeated, reminding him of their friendship. He then fights Rishikodagan and decapitates him.
Finally, as Rana and Vadhana reunite, a young soldier comes towards them riding a horse. This soldier is revealed to be Sena, who looks surprisingly angered, as their father had asked him to protect the king but Rana had killed him, indicating that a fight awaits.",4.8

Things go well until Anamika gets kidnapped by two men. Arjun, who was in the bathroom when Anamika was kidnapped, immediately lodges a complaint at the Besant Nagar police station. Sub-Inspector Arumugam (M. S. Baskar), who is assigned the case, then goes to Anamika's apartment along with Arjun, but the apartment is now cleaned up and there seems to be no sign that a kidnapping has taken place, while the apartment's watchman insists that Anamika had not returned to her apartment for three days. Also, the CCTV camera installed at the apartment does not show any men arriving and taking away Anamika, prompting Arumugam to suspect that Arjun has lodged a false complaint as he is drunk. However, when Arumugam calls up Anamika's father Raghunath Kumar (Shankar Sundaram), the chairman of the TV news channel Channel 24, he merely replies that he doesn't know anything about the kidnapping and that Anamika is holidaying in Goa, at which Arumugam suspects something amiss, realising that Arjun had not lied after all. Arumugam and Arjun rush to Raghunath's mansion, where they see him being threatened by the two men who had kidnapped Anamika as well as the police inspector of Besant Nagar to give them a SD card which has some critical information. Raghunath calls up his editor and asks him to give the SD card to the three men, after which he is killed by them. Arjun and Arumugam pursue the three men. While Arjun manages to kill the police inspector, the other two men escape, killing Arumugam in the process.
Arjun then goes to the Channel 24 office, where he witnesses the two men coming out of the office with the SD card (and having killed the editor in the process). He hides in the SUV which they are travelling in, pursuing them till a brothel, where he finds Anamika unconscious and gagged. He frees her, takes away the SD card and then escapes with her. The two men then contact their boss, who is the chief rowdy and right hand of the Union Minister for Communications and Information Technology and potential Prime Ministerial candidate Rishi Dev (J. D. Chakravarthy). He kills the two men and informs the situation to rishi dev, who decides to rush to Chennai within the next three hours.
Having got the SD card as well as its password, Arjun inserts the memory card into his mobile phone and sees that it has only one file in it; a video. The video shows the murder of model-turned-actress Megha Sharma (Lekha Washington) at the hands of Rishi Dev two days ago and how he had fabricated the incident to make it look like the actress died due to a gas leak at her mansion. Arjun and Anamika, horrified on seeing this and also on the extent to which Rishi Dev's henchmen went to keep the video from being seen, decide to expose Rishi Dev by uploading the video on YouTube. This backfires when Arjun's friend Raj (Arjunan), brings Rishi Dev's henchmen to the hotel room where Arjun and Anamika are staying, having been bribed by them to do so. They manage to subdue Raj as well as Rishi Dev's henchmen and go on the run.
Meanwhile, Rishi Dev arrives in Chennai, and after finding out that Arjun and Anamika attempted to upload the video on YouTube, blocks Internet access in Chennai. He also lodges a false complaint against them to the police commissioner Arulraj (Yog Japee), claiming that they killed Raghunath to get his money and also to fuel Anamika's ""drug-addiction"". This makes Arjun and Anamika fugitives, with every movement of them now being tracked by the police. Anamika, in incognito, manages to contact every leading media house to assemble at the Forum Vijaya Mall (where they are hiding) at 3 pm as there is going to be a ""sensational event"" there. This move backfires completely on Arjun and Anamika, as Anamika accidentally breaks the SD card, destroying the only piece of evidence which is against Rishi Dev. The police take advantage of the media assembled at the mall and claim on live television that Arjun and Anamika are murderers, announcing a ₹ 5 lakh reward for those who capture them.
Arjun then hatches another plan to expose Rishi Dev. He contacts Rishi Dev through the Arulraj, asking him to meet him later that night at his private airfield alone. At the airfield, he tries to force Rishi Dev to reveal the truth about Megha Sharma's death, using his mobile phone to record the meeting. But before he can get out the truth, the police arrive, following which Rishi Dev destroys the mobile phone and beats him up, all the while revealing that he killed Megha Sharma, but he cannot do anything about it because he is going to be arrested for the attempted murder of a Union Minister. Unfortunately for Rishi Dev, Arjun had organized their entire meeting, as well as Rishi Dev's revelation, using a button camera, with the video having been shared using 3G connectivity to Anamika, who then ensured that the video was broadcast live by all leading TV news channels, thus exposing Rishi Dev, who is soon arrested.
A few weeks later, Arjun and Anamika, whose names have now been cleared of all charges, go on another date at a beach resort. During the date, Arjun proposes marriage to Anamika, to which she agrees.",7.3

Mahendra) who says that the existence of ghosts is true and he should stop whining and start helping the soul and make it rest in peace.
Hilarious incidents unfold, as Meenakshi and Venkat get in the process of finding her identity.

Venkat, Divya, Mathrubootham and Meenakshi try to stop this racket, but the doctor cleverly manipulates Divya's mother to agree for a surgery using Kavya's deteriorating health as bait.

So, Divya takes the matter into her hands and possesses Dr.Rangarajan as he is about to start the surgery. She makes him slit his own throat and commit suicide and the surgery is stopped. After a while, Kavya regains consciousness and Divya is at peace and she says she loves venkat and she leaves after a final adieu to all of them.

2014,Jigarthanda,Tamil,Karthik Subbaraj,"Siddharth, Lakshmi Menon, Bobby Simha",mob,"Karthik Subramani (Siddharth) is a short-film maker and aspires to make a feature film. He participates in a talent search program (like Naalaya Iyakkunar) and is in the semi-final round. The show’s two judges include a highbrow film director (Nassar) who trashes Karthik’s attempt at film-making and a profit-oriented producer (Aadukalam Naren) who riles against the director, and declares that Karthik made the best film among the contestants. Though the director eliminates Karthik from the contest, the producer offers to produce a film with Karthik as the director and both the judges storm out of the show. The next day, the producer is annoyed that Karthik took his words seriously and came to meet him. He is uninterested in the script that Karthik wants to film, and instead suggests that he wants to make a gangster film along the style of Nayakan, Thalapathi, The Godfather etc. Karthik takes this suggestion to heart and sets his mind on documenting the life of a gangster and making a film script out of it.
With help from his journalist uncle (Gajaraj), Karthik finds out about ""Assault"" Sethu (Bobby Simha), a ruthless gangster in the city of Madurai, and decides that he will make a film about the life of Sethu. He travels to Madurai and enlists the help of a reluctant college friend Oorani (Karunakaran) to conduct surveillance on Sethu and his men. Since Karthik and Oorani are afraid of approaching Sethu directly, they plot to develop contacts with two of Sethu’s top henchmen. They also try to obtain information from an old shopkeeper (Sangili Murugan) who has been around since Sethu was a kid. To get closer to Sethu, Karthik also puts up an act of reciprocating the love of Kayalvizhi (Lakshmi Menon), whose mother (Ambika) cooks for Sethu. Because of their various attempts to seek information about Sethu, they arouse the suspicion of Rasu (Ramachandran Durairaj), Sethu’s right-hand man, who puts an underling, Sounder (Senthil Kumaran) to watch Karthik and Oorani. Sounder becomes good friends with Karthik, and Karthik uses his trust to plant a wireless microphone in a music player that he lends to Sounder. In a quick turn of events, Sounder is busted as a mole for an opposing gang and is killed.
Sethu finds out the tap placed in the music player that Sounder was carrying and quickly locates Karthik and Oorani. When about to die at the hands of Sethu, Karthik confesses that he was spying on Sethu so that he could make a movie about his life, along the lines of Nayakan, Thalapathi, The Godfather, and etc.. Sethu is enamored by the prospect of his life being portrayed on the big screen and initiates Karthik and Oorani into his gang so that they can document his life. He and his gang members boast of their crimes and take Karthik along for their gang activities. Karthik gleefully documents everything and is ecstatic that he has a fantastic story in hand for his debut movie. When he is ready to leave Madurai with all the information that he ever needed, Kayal discovers that Karthik used her for information and is vengeful. Sethu invites him for a send-off party. During the partying, Kayal remarks that Sethu himself should act as the main character in the gangster film about his life. Sethu takes this seriously and threatens Karthik to direct the film with Sethu playing himself on screen. Distraught at the sudden turn of events, Karthik tries to flee out of Madurai but is caught by Sethu’s gang. They also kidnap the producer of Karthik’s film and force them both to make the gangster movie.
Karthik reluctantly agrees, but soon finds that Sethu and his men cannot act in front of a camera. He hires an acting coach Muthu (Guru Somasundaram), who sets up a rigorous teaching schedule for Sethu and his men. After a period of training, Muthu thinks that while the others are hopeless, Sethu has at least a sliver of acting talent. The production of the movie commences and Karthik becomes quite frustrated with Sethu’s acting ineptitude. Still, he perseveres with the movie and has Muthu coach Sethu in emotional crying scenes in between breaks. Finally, the production is wrapped. Sethu and his men are on cloud nine and create a great fanfare for the movie’s release. The film releases and during the first show, Sethu gets the shock of his life. Realizing that a serious gangster film featuring Sethu would be a disaster, Karthik had surreptitiously changed the story of the film into a comedy. He edits and dubs over Sethu’s voice in such a way that the film shows Sethu as a guy who achieves everything in life by crying. The film’s title A. Kumar is revealed to be Azhuguni (Crybaby) Kumar and not Assault Kumar as Sethu had thought. The film receives a tremendous response from the audience who left theaters in tears after laughing their guts out. Sethu is mad at being made a fool to the world and searches for Karthik. However, Karthik and the rest of the crew go into hiding in anticipation of Sethu’s wrath.
While searching for Karthik and his crew, Sethu encounters events that make him realize that the fear that people have for him does not equal respect. He finds that by making people laugh inadvertently through his film, he had earned true respect than respect by fear such as his mother, who never spoke to him, ever since he became a gangster and finally spoke to Sethu after seeing his film. In a final face-off, Sethu and Karthik meet each other by accident, he's on his way to deliver the video recordings of Sethu’s boastful confessions to the police. Sethu pardons Karthik in a dramatic way and Karthik chooses to put Sethu’s past behind him and let him seek a new life. They each go on to pursue careers in the movie industry. Karthik now has started to use Sethu's gang to bully people such as Vijay Sethupathi into acting for his movies, while Sethu started working as an actor by acting in a film made by Vetrimaaran. Sethu also has married Sounder's wife while Karthik married Kayalvizhi.",6.6

Seeing that her father never loved her and was instead happy she had died, she kills him in cold blood and splits the ransom money with Vikram.

Johnny initially didn't recognize Raju, until Raju unfold his shirt's collar. Johnny attempts to pin and frame everything on Jackie, only to be confronted by him as well.
Johnny was forced to revealed that on the day of the meeting, which took place in a hotel/apartment, that while Chandru, Amar, Johnny, and Manoj waited for JK, Chandru had a state change of mind about the meeting having earlier wanted to do it with Raju and decided to do it another day with Raju being here. The doorbell ranged and Chandru thought it was JK, only to for it to be revealed as Imran and his henchmen. They hold Chandru, Amar, Johnny, and Manoj as hostages and wanted Chandru to call Raju and get him to come here. Chandru had given them one chance to kill him, but not to kill Amar, Johnny, and Manoj. This resulted in a quick and short between Chandru and Imran's henchmen, in which Chandru won. Chandru was about to kill Imran, only to be grabbed by Amar, Johnny, and Manoj.
They along with Imran had plotted to betray and kill Chandru and Raju, with Imran promising them, that they can become very powerful dons like and alongside him in ruling the streets and the whole city of Mumbai. When Raju attempted to call Chandru, Amar answered in his place making unaware of what is happening to Chandru. Chandru, being taunted by Imran over Amar's replies towards Raju in the cellphone conversation, he ended up breaking his cellphone, cutting and canceling Raju's call. Imran killed Chandru by slashing him multiple times with a knife. Before Chandru dies, he warns Imran, Amar, Johnny, and Manoj, that Raju will come back and kill them all. A disappointed and upset Raju kills Johnny.

He then founded out that Raju had earlier attempted to visit him in his office of his company's building disguised as Krishna in the last previous week. He sees through the footage of his security camera, that Raju has arrived again to his company building and Manoj ordered his assistant to bring him to his office. Manoj, thinking that Raju is 'Krishna' and telling him some noted details about Raju such as having a toothpick in his mouth, an unfolded collar on his shirt, and a scar on his right eyebrow, while telling his arrival to Mumbai is a waste of time and that Raju is 'dead', unaware that he is still alive and is standing before him disguised as 'Krishna'.Imran called him on his cellphone and Manoj had a conversation with him talking about his birthday party being held at a grand hotel, which Raju overheard and took note of it, all the while for Manoj to explain to Imran about 'Krishna'.
'Krishna' then tells Manoj, that Raju is alive and is in his building, causing Manoj to send his henchmen to search his company building around for Raju, while he hold 'Krishna' at gunpoint. Raju then reveals his identity by revealing all noted details that Manoj pointed about him earlier and beats up Manoj and his henchmen. Raju kills all the henchmen and was about to kill Manoj, but Manoj tries to get Raju to spare his life by offering a deal to be successful in life. Raju seems to accept, but he ended punching Manoj in the face and refusing his deal, all the while, angrily killing him by shooting in the head with his own gun. Raju, having killed all the betrayers of his former gang heads back to Karim's place by Raja, who he still thinks he is 'Krishna'.
After taking a bath, Raju is handed a towel by Karim's daughter, who reminded of Jeeva. He then remembered at one time, that Raju, Chandru, and Jeeva went to a musical concert, which is finished, but using their influence and having been friends with the theatre manager of the concert, they get the concert back on running. At first, Guru Shastri (Brahmanandam), the head of the musical troupe performing the concert refuses to play for them given the fact that Raju and Chandru are gangsters/dons, but accepts, when Chandru pointed out Raju and Jeeva are lovers and Jeeva wanted to see his concert. Unfortunately, Guru Shastri's music turned out to be awful making Raju, Chandru, and Jeeva leave the theater in disgust.
Then, a parade with some very good music came by and they all danced to it for fun and in celebration. It was there, that Jeeva understands the friendship between Raju and Chandru. Raju then attempted to kill Imran in his birthday party, only to fail, when that it is revealed Imran is not in India, but is in Dubai doing a live telecast call in the hotel of his birthday party. He also reveals that he know Raju is still alive and threatens to kill him. Imran's henchmen searched everywhere for Raju, including checking into the hotel he rented a room there. Then Imran's henchmen came at Karim 's house and search everywhere for Raju, but he is not there. So they kidnap Karim's daughter to hold her as a hostage in order to make Raju come to them.
When Raju and Karim came there, Karim was told that his daughter is kidnapped. When Raju prepares to go rescue Karim's daughter, Karim reveals him that wasn't his daughter, who has been kidnapped, but it was none other than Jeeva. Jeeva, knowing that Raju is alive given that his 'body' is never found and knowing that he will come back to Mumbai, decides to wait for him, until he finishes his quest for revenge against Imran for Chandru's death, understanding how much Chandru meant to him. Raju went to the location, beats up the henchmen, and gets Jeeva, who had her left hand injured by the leader of the henchmen using his smoking cigarette to safety by having be taken away by Karim, while killing all of them including the leader, who before dying founded out Jeeva was Raju's lover because her left hand had a tattoo of Raju's name on it, which she got during the time she and Raju had a blast.
Unfortunately, he gets captured by Imran's top four henchmen and was taken to get killed by Imran face to face. Imran was about to kill Raju with the very same knife he had used to kill Chandru, only to held gunpoint by his main henchmen, which are now of them. Raju reveals just like how Imran got Amar, Johnny, and Manoj to betray him and Chandru, he used Imran's own remaining henchmen to betray him by making a similar deal to them, that Imran made to Amar, Johnny, and Manoj. When one of them remains faithful to Imran, while the other three decided to betray him, one of the three, mainly the leader of the group killed the faithful one. Raju grabbed Imran's knife from him and killed in the very exact way Imran killed Chandru, while Imran realizes his fate is sealed before he died.
Fulfilling his revenge over Chandru's death, the henchmen decides to clear up Imran's murder and ask Raju to leave, only for Raju to double crosses them all and killed them with a gun. Raju reunites with Jeeva and they both were leaving Mumbai, until they bump into Raja, who has noticed that 'Krishna' has never found Raju, but instead found a beautiful girl in Jeeva. When Raja saw that 'Krishna' is walking without his crutch, he ask him about him, only for 'Krishna' to reveal his true identity as Raju Bhai, by having a toothpick in his mouth, leaving Raja shocked.

However, Murali is against becoming a policeman due to an incident which happened in his childhood; when Chellapa lost his leg during police duty, his wife fell down the stairs on hearing the news, leading to her death and left a crippled Chellapa to single-handedly look after the young Murali. His ambition is to become a bank manager and he manages to get an interview for the same in a bank.

She expresses a distaste for marrying policemen, which impresses Murali.
Meanwhile, a spate of robberies occur in Chennai. Money is stolen from several bank accounts through ATM machines. The robberies are led by a bank employee Shiva (Gaurav Narayanan) assisted by a karate teacher Lawrence (Charandeep). The duo manage to avoid being caught as they hide their identity by wearing bike helmets. Murali first encounters the duo robbing an ATM while returning from the pilgrimage and breaks Lawrence's arm in a fight. An injured Lawrence vows to take revenge on Murali for breaking his arm.
Later, Murali receives a letter stating that he had been accepted at the Tamil Nadu Police Academy for police training. He reluctantly attends the training for Chellapa's sake and deliberately performs poorly during the training in the hope of getting expelled from the academy. Unfortunately, the head of the academy, SP Nagaraj, who happens to be Ambujam's father and a former colleague of Chellapa, finds out about Murali's plan and makes a deal with him to avoid the matter reaching Chellapa's ears; however badly Murali had performed during training, he will not be expelled from the academy. Instead, he will be made a sub-inspector, with the assurance that he can resign if he doesn't like the job after 30 days, after which he can marry Ambujam. Murali accepts, but this strains his relationship with Ambujam.
Shiva and Lawrence plan to steal money from ATMs using information from international credit cards. The robbery is a success, but the CCTV cameras in two different ATMs have exposed Shiva as one of the robbers due to his height. The duo are arrested by Murali, who is now a sub-inspector, but they manage to subdue the constables and escape later that night, while Murali is out on a date with Ambujam. They encounter Chellapa, mercilessly beat him up and shoot him in the chest. Ambujam feels sorry about what happened to Chellapa and finally accepts Murali's decision to become a policeman.
Buoyed by Ambujam's approval, and also determined to take revenge on those who shot Chellapa, Murali takes up the robbery case with full vigour. He assumes that the duo did not work alone, instead having an accomplice. This proves to be true; the accomplice turns out to be a forger who made fake credit cards for the duo to steal money from the ATMs, but this evidence reaches a dead end when the accomplice reveals that he never saw the duo without their bike helmets on. Murali then interrogates the security guards of ATMs in the outskirts of Chennai as he feels that the robbers would have used them to conduct their robberies since money would not be refilled in such ATMs until it runs short of cash due to lesser number of withdrawals unlike in ATMs within the city where refilling of cash is done regularly. One of the guards interrogated turns out to be an accomplice of the robbers, providing them gadgets to assist them in the robbery. He however, doesn't know where they are. Murali decides to track the robber's phones with the intention of finding their location once someone calls them. In retribution, Shiva and Lawrence try to kill Chellapa, who is in the ICU, also kidnapping Ambujam in the process. Murali rushes to the hospital, where he sees Chellapa still alive, after which he pursues the robbers, finally encountering them on the banks of the Cooum river. He kills both of them and rescues Ambujam.

They are going to tidy the palace for owners who are coming to their ancestral Aranmanai (palace) to sell it. During the night, the cook (Kadhal Dhandapani) is frightened by some supernatural being in the palace and he disappears.
The next day, an estranged Eshwari (Kovai Sarala) returns with her husband (Manobala) and son Muliankannan (Nithin Sathya). Eshwari's brother (Chitra Lakshmanan) and his daughter Maya (Raai Laxmi) welcome them. The brother and sister, along with another older brother's son Murali (Vinay Rai) and his new wife Madhavi (Andrea Jeremiah) have gathered to sell their Palace off to Ayyanar, who had leased the property for five years. Meanwhile, Paalsamy (Santhanam) sneaks into Aranmanai under the guise of a cook, to find a photograph that is a sole evidence that he is also an heir to the palace, so that he can claim his share of the money.
They stay at the Aranmanai but strange incidents happen. Madhavi sees a servant's daughter talking to an mysterious girl called Selvi . The mother of the girl explains that she's autistic. Mishaps continue to happen and they are unable to sell the palace, so they extend their stay. Meanwhile, 2 other servants have also gone missing. Now Ravi (Sundar.C), the older brother of Madhavi, comes to the palace to meet his sister. Hilarious incidents happen as Paalsamy tries to woo Maya and he has Ravi and Muliankannan competing with him. Madhavi and Maya tell Ravi that there are weird things happening in the house. So he sets cameras up around the house with Maya's help.
Ravi sees that a worker is backing away from something, but the camera starts to fizz and goes out. At the same time, a fortune teller (Yogi Babu) in front of the house runs away in terror, seeing something. The next day in the village pond, there are three bodies of the murdered servants found by the cops. Ravi is shocked and visits the fortune teller who ran away from his house that night. The man reveals that he witness a worker being killed by a woman possessed as a vengeful spirit and he gives him an egg, and tells that when the possessed person is within the egg's radius, it will start spinning. The police officers interrogate all the members of the house about the murders with Ravi seated opposite them and the egg placed in front of him. Finally when the egg spins, he looks up to see none other than his sister Madhavi sitting for interrogation. He follows her and sees Madhavi don a big round of vermilion on her forehead but her reflection shows Selvi (Hansika Motwani). Relating the little girl's talks and the name Selvi, Ravi sets out to investigate.
Villagers say that Selvi was the girl who stole the Temple deity's jewels and ran off from the village. He comes across Selvi's friend Ramya, who says that Selvi was a good person and not a thief. She says that back then, Murali was not yet married and when he came to the village he fell in love with Selvi. Selvi also liked him but she is a girl who is often possessed by the goddess and predicts future. So she held herself back to maintain her holiness. On the day Murali was leaving the village, he expected her reply and asked her to meet him at his house. Ramya encouraged Selvi to go and confess her love to Murali. Selvi left the house on that note but she has been missing till now.
Per Ravi's plan, when Ramya comes to meet the possessed Madhavi as selvi, she recognizes Ramya and tells her all that happened after she left the house that day. It seems that Ayyanar and his friends (the workers) replaced the temple jewelry with fake ones and Selvi found it out using her premonition and confronted them. So they brutally killed her and buried her inside the palace when she came to meet Murali. She also says that she wants to be with Murali always. As today is an auspicious day, if she gets intimate with Murali, no one can ever drive her out of Madhavi's body. If they cannot get close today, she will kill Murali, so that they will be together in death.
After hearing the story Ravi hears this and tries to stop selvi but in vain. He meets a priest (Kota Srinivasa Rao) who says that there is only two ways to stop Selvi's mayhem. One is by using a strong emotion to bring Madhavi to her senses while she is possessed. It is a tough job and the other option is to bring Murali to the river junction where the ritual of the Eclipse takes place and goddess deities will be immersed in the river, generating a powerful energy which will help in separating Selvi's soul from Madhavi.

Then comes the tournament that selects the players for the Tamil Nadu Ranji Trophy team and as expected both Jeeva and Ranjith get selected. But the real trouble starts after joining the Team.

They are given chances in tough conditions where it's hard to score more runs. But still they manage to put up a decent performance. Jeeva even once gets applauded by the Captain of the Rajasthan team, who is a veteran national team member.

Karthik works as a manager in a firm, and they live happily and help everyone around according to their capacity and have a beautiful daughter, Vennila. Meanwhile, Ilavarasi (Srinda Ashab), a new neighbor in their apartment arrives, and she lives right next door. Ilavarasi is the daughter of a rich money lender. He is a greedy loan shark who goes to any extent to get his loaned money back from the people who borrowed it. He loves his daughter and will get anything she points at and will do anything for her. Ilavarasi, as a result of this upbringing, is an arrogant, spoilt brat of a woman and she is married to a spineless man who does whatever she bids him to do. Though Thenmozhi does not have a good opinion about Ilavarasi in the beginning, they become friends after an incident where Ilavarasi thrashes a stalker who was harassing Thenmozhi repeatedly over phone. Soon, the women become good friends and enjoy each other's company over the day and spend a lot of time together.
One day, when Karthik and Thenmozhi are preparing for a wedding in Karthik's employer's family, Thenu says that she has only a simple jewelry and will feel out of place and belittled at such a grand wedding. Since Karthik is not in a comfortable financial state to buy her some jewels, she decides to ask Ilavarasi if she could borrow her necklace and return it after the ceremony, and Ilavarasi also happily obliges. The trouble begins when Thenmozhi loses the expensive necklace to a chain snatcher thief on their way back home.
When Ilavarasi's father learns of this, he becomes wild and scolds Thenmozhi, Karthik and even his own daughter and asks Karthik to lodge a formal complaint to the police. The policemen's attitude towards this issue is lethargic and they treat them with negligence. Meanwhile, the inspector tells to Ilavarasi's father that while Thenmozhi's own chain is still intact, his daughter's jewelry alone is gone, so even Thenmozhi and Karthik could be possible suspects and this kind of cheating is the latest trend among robbers these days. Ilavarasi's father hears this and poisons Ilavarasi's mind also. She also misjudges certain incidents with Thenu, and distances herself slowly, believing her dad. One fine day, Ilavarasi throws a surprise party for Karthik and Thenu's wedding anniversary and gifts an expensive showpiece. But day after day, Ilavarasi's father continues to verbally abuse them and looks at them as thieves. Then, the baby Vennila gets kidnapped suddenly, and after some commotions, Karthik learns that Ilavarasi and her father have orchestrated the whole kidnap drama, to check if they have the money from selling the stolen necklace. Karthik is enraged and argues with Ilavarasi's father who asks him to first find the stolen necklace or at least give the money for the jewelry's worth and then talk as much as he pleases. Karthik, unable to see his family suffer humiliation, agrees to give back the money somehow.
He goes to his village to sell a property leaving Thenu and Vennila at home. But here too, the land brokers make use of his helpless emergency situation and buy the land for exactly the amount Karthik owes Ilavarasi's father, much lesser than the land's actual worth. Karthik comes back to the city with the money but is in for a rude shock. He finds that Thenu has committed suicide by hanging herself. He reads her suicide note, where she tells that there was a secret camera in the gift Ilavarasi gave for their anniversary and their intimate moments were filmed and leaked to the internet. Her stalker had seen this and verbally abused her in public. When she confronted Ilavarasi and her father about this, he told that they fixed the camera only to monitor their activities to find the truth about the theft and they are not responsible if the video is leaked to the internet somehow. When she argued with him, he slapped and humiliated her further. Unable to bear all the humiliation, she has taken this extreme step.
Karthik is blinded with fury after reading this and when Ilavarasi's father comes to get his money, he gives it to him and asks him to return his dead wife. This leads to an argument and he is beaten up by goons, but he bashes all of them and finally strangles Ilavarasi's father to death with his own gold chains. No one except Ilavarasi stops Karthik, not even Ilavarasi's husband. At the end, we see that Karthik cries out loud, looking at the state he left his baby daughter Vennila in.",5.6

He goes to Chennai and decides to escape to Bangkok with his friend and fellow-criminal Ravi (Sathish). However, he drops this plan after meeting and falling in love with Ankitha (Samantha Ruth Prabhu) at the airport, who dupes him into believing that she wants to marry him after realising that he is having a crush on her. Later, Kathiresan and Ravi notice a doppelgänger of Kathiresan named Jeevanandam ""Jeeva"" (also Vijay), being shot by a group of thugs. They admit him to a hospital, following which Kathiresan decides to impersonate the injured Jeevanandam to escape from the police. Under the name of his doppelgänger, Kathiresan and Ravi enter an old-age home run by Jeevanandam with the aim of collecting ₹25 lakhs (which is meant for the inmates of the old-age home) for their Bangkok trip, until he learns about his doppelgänger's mission. Jeevanandam is a communist ideologue and a post-graduate in hydrology from the arid village of Thanoothu in Tirunelveli district who had discovered groundwater under some lands of the village which could be used as an irrigation source not only for the village, but for the entire Tirunelveli district and the neighbouring Thoothukudi district as well. But, an MNC owned by Chirag (Neil Nitin Mukesh) cheated the villagers into giving their lands for the construction of a factory. Jeevanandam gets arrested by the police and six villagers commit suicide to bring this news to the media forefront and release Jeevanandham from prison. On learning of the plight of Jeevanandam and the villagers, Kathiresan decides to fight for their cause while still under the name of Jeevanandam. The people of the old home and Kathiresan go to the jury and try to convince him to go in favour of them, but Kathiresan starts stating rules and scares the main jury person (whom Chirag had bribed). Kathiresan then sends a person (disguised as a hairdresser) to Chirag and makes him lay a fingerprint on Chirag's neck. After that Chirag sends 50 men to kill Kathiresan but he soon defeats them using the coins the villagers gave when he was attending a ceremony for him.
Meanwhile, the real Jeevanandam gains consciousness and finds himself in the Kolkata prison where Kathiresan was locked up. With the help of Vivek, who has heard his story and has plans to kill Kathiresan in revenge for getting him caught and thrown back into prison, he soon escapes along with Vivek's henchmen.
Not knowing that Jeevanandam and Vivek's henchmen are headed for Chennai, Kathiresan makes efforts to convince the media to bring the plight of the villagers to national consciousness, but the media is not interested as they feel that it is not a sensational news. A few days later, at the Madras High Court, the judge declares the verdict in favour of Jeevanandam and the villagers, but adds that Chirag has claimed that certain villagers who are working abroad have shown their support for the factory. If they cannot prove that their support was faked by Chirag within the next five days, the verdict will then go in favour of Chirag and the villagers will lose their lands. Since the villagers, who have denied supporting the factory, are abroad and cannot come to Chennai within five days to rebut Chirag's claims as their passports are held by their contractors, and the verdict is to be decided within five days, Kathiresan decides to take drastic measures to sensationalise the issue. He, Ankitha, Ravi and the inmates of the old-age home block water supply to Chennai by sitting on the pipelines which carry water to Chennai from five lakes. With the plight of the Chennaites due to no water supply having gained national attention, Kathiresan comes out of the pipeline after a few days and highlights the villagers' plight in an emotionally charged speech to the media, which is telecast nationwide and moves many people. By now, Kathiresan has discovered that Jeevanandam has escaped and is searching for him.
Meanwhile, Jeevanandam and Vivek's henchmen reach Chennai, but Jeevanandam is soon kidnapped by Chirag's henchmen. While in Chirag's custody, he sees Kathiresan's speech on television and is moved by the efforts made by his doppelgänger to help the villagers. On the night before the verdict, Kathiresan's bluff is exposed, but Kathiresan assures the old men that he is genuinely interested in their cause, that Jeevanandam is alive and that he will rescue Jeevanandam from Chirag and hand him back over to the villagers with the assurance of a positive verdict. Kathiresan goes to Chirag's office, where Jeevanandam is being held. He rescues Jeevanandam and fights Chirag and his henchmen, killing Chirag in the process.
The next day, the verdict is declared in favour of Jeevanandam and the villagers. Kathiresan, despite his efforts to thwart Chirag and the MNC, does not take part in the ensuing celebrations over the verdict and instead surrenders to the police and returns to the Kolkata prison, but not before promising Ankitha, who has now fallen in love with him, that he will marry her once he is released.

Kali says that he knows it was Gomathi who told Swami about his frequent visits to Rangamma's place and he also says that he knows the person who made him sent to jail was the arrangement of Gomathi.

Ravikumar,"Rajinikanth, Anushka Shetty, Sonakshi Sinha",action,"A dam in the village of Solaiyur, which is the lifeline of that village is under assessment for structural integrity by the Public Works Department. The dam inspector (Ponvannan) assesses that the dam is still strong 75 years after it was built. Later that evening, he is hanged to death by the corrupt local MP Nagabhushan (Jagapathi Babu), who wants the dam destroyed for his own benefit. The dying dam inspector throws a pen drive containing details about the proposed plan to destroy the dam into an abandoned Shiva temple near the dam and warns the village head Karunakara (K. Viswanath) that the temple has to be opened as soon as possible, after which he passes away. Karunakara and the villagers are of the opinion that the temple can only be opened by the descendant of Raja Lingeswaran (Rajnikanth), who built the dam as well as the Shiva temple. Lakshmi (Anushka Shetty), the granddaughter of Karunakara and a television journalist, goes on a search to find the Raja's descendant. She soon manages to find the descendant, whose name is Lingeswaran aka Lingaa (Rajnikanth). Lingaa is the grandson of Raja Lingeswaran, but is a petty thief with his family having now fallen on hard times. He holds a grudge against his grandfather, feeling that he had brought down his family into poverty by squandering all his wealth and hence refuses to go with Lakshmi to Solaiyur. However, Lakshmi implicates Lingaa in a robbery, as a result of which the police pursue Lingaa. Lingaa is forced to accept Lakshmi's invitation to avoid getting caught and travels with her to Solaiyur.
At Solaiyur, Lingaa finds out that the Lingam installed at the Shiva temple is made of Maragatham stone (Emerald), which is extremely valuable, so at midnight, he enters the Shiva temple with the intention to steal the Lingam. But he is noticed by one of the dam's security guards, who immediately alerts all the villagers including Lakshmi, Karunakara and Nagabhushan, to the temple courtyard. Aware of the villagers' presence, Lingaa pretends to perform pooja to the Lingam. This fools the villagers, who find it auspicious that the grandson of Raja Lingeswaran is performing pooja to the Shiva Lingam installed at the temple built by the Raja at on the occasion of Maha Shivaratri. Karunakara then tells everyone present, including Lingaa, the story of Raja Lingeswaran.
Raja Lingeswaran, the very rich ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Kodiyur, best civil engineer from Cambridge and a civil services officer. He becomes the collector of Madurai district, and arrives at Solaiyur village. There the people tell him that they have no water for 9 months per year, and the other 3 months they have heavy rainfall and floods. They are unable to store water and the resulting famines cause hundreds of deaths every year. Though the collector applies to construct a dam, his plan is rejected in the annual collectors' meeting and he is forced to approve a new railroad from Tuticorin to Kochi through Madurai for goods. He refuses to do so and is blackmailed that he will be fired. He immediately resigns his job and exits.
Later the scene shifts to a palace, wherein all the British and Indian guests arrive in the background of a birthday party given by the erstwhile Maharaja of Kodiyur. It is later revealed that, the Maharaja is none other than Lingeshwaran (rajinikanth). In the context of hospitality, the Maharaja lets slip that he resigned his post of Collector in order to serve the people of his native. When inquired about it, he expresses his wish to construct a dam at Solaiyur, with his own money and man power, claiming all he needed was only a signature in the form of permission from the British Government. The Governor approves it (after a discreet conversation with his lieutenants, plotting to gain something out of it), gives permission along with a signed order the next day. Though he faces multiple difficulties, the dam is constructed with the help of local man power from the Solaiyur village. It is shown that the Solaiyur village people are very co-operative with Raja Lingeshwaran and work with him cordially, except for small feud and near stoppage of work due to a caste remark ignited by Sambandam (R. Sundarrajan), who is later understood to be a spy for the British Collector. Finally, the dam is almost completed except for the shaft doors. The doors are being held in custody by the new collector as stolen goods and the floods are soon to occur. Raja Lingeshwaran negotiates with the new collector who proposes that the king gives him all his property (100% of the entire yield) as bribe and all credit of constructing the dam goes to him and British government. The king with whole heart does so. Apart from that, he sells his Palace, gold and silver and other lands he possesses to gain back the land grabbed by the new collector. Sambandam plays a trick here by bringing the villagers to the palace at the same time when Raja gives away his property documents, gold and silver, and makes them believe that, the Raja is a spy of the British. The dam is fully constructed in 1939 at Solaiyur to solve the water problems of that village. The British lie to the villagers that the Raja was a British spy who would hand over the dam and all the villagers' lands to the British once the dam was completed. However, the freedom fighter, Kavi barathi (Radha ravi) and another set of few people believe that, the raja is really innocent. The irate villagers throw the Raja out of Solaiyur. The Raja boards a train with Sami Pillai, and Barathi, who joins him apart from his foreboding. Truth comes out in the form of the Collector's wife when she confronts the villagers when they come to meet him for taking back the land which was taken. She reveals that the agreement signed by Raja Lingeshwaran was almost burned by the Collector's assistant and she in time retrieved it and shows them the document, there by revealing the true identity of the Collector. Later, the villagers realize Sambandam's double play and chase him. unable to face the villagers and due to his own guilt, he jumps off the dam wall and drowns in the reservoir. After a long search, the villagers find the Raja and his wife Bharathi (Sonakshi Sinha), but living in poverty. After unsuccessfully trying to convince the Raja to return to Solaiyur, the villagers decided to keep the Shiva temple which was built along with the dam, closed until the Raja or his descendants returned to the village. Lingaa, on hearing the Raja's story, changes his opinion about his grandfather and decides to mend his ways.
Story unfolds again when Lingaa decides to leave the village. He is stopped by the Chief (K. Viswanath), asking to stay behind, as he feels something bad is about to happen to the village, as it almost happened 70 years back. It is revealed that the honest Dam inspector (Ponvannan) was killed by MP and the new inspector (Jayaprakash) would be inspecting the dam for a name sake, thereby drilling holes in the dam, to be filled with explosives later by MP's personnel. Finally, the same is revealed to the entire village and broadcast to all Government offices the plot by MP, which was secretly shot by Lakshmi. After an ensuing fight, Lingaa makes the bomb to explode in the water, instead on the dam and the movie ends with Lingaa and Lakshmi, who are now in love with each other, leaving Solaiyur, with Lingaa deciding to return once he has done something good in life like his grandfather.",5.6

Traumatized by the whole episode, Siddharth comes home with one of her slippers. He then drives around the city aimlessly with his red car while helping homeless people, unable to come out of the depression due to the girl's death.
After the incident, strange things start happening at Siddharth's apartment. He begins to feel a supernatural presence at his house. The house is cleaned up even if he makes it messy and his bottle opener goes missing whenever he tries to drink beer. With the help of his friend Badri (Ashvatt), he employs a psychic to exorcise the ghost, but she turns out to be a fraud and is scared out of the apartment by a strange apparition. Siddharth also comes to realise that his next door neighbour's autistic son plays with an imaginary friend. When Siddharth's mother (Kalyani N), Janaki comes to visit him, she is hit by a drunk neighbour (Harish Uthaman), who is abusing his wife (Kani Kusruti). The neighbour is then attacked by a mysterious ghost. The following day, Janaki meets with a freak accident in the bathroom and is saved by the ghost who alerts the neighbours. But, Siddharth mistakes that the ghost had attacked his mother and threatens the ghost that he would kill himself and come as a ghost to take revenge on her. Many rituals of various religions to drive the ghost away were performed by Siddharth, but everything is proven futile and the ghost continues to stay. Also, a petty thief is also stabbed while trying to steal from Siddharth's apartment.
Siddharth is assured that the ghost of the girl whose life he tried to save is behind all these strange occurrences and goes in search of her family to see if they can help get rid of her. He finds that girl's name is Bhavani and her father (Radha Ravi) runs a local ice factory. Siddharth confronts the father and asks him to cremate his daughter to save him from her ghost. Siddharth brings the father to his apartment to show him the ghost, when his mother calls from the hospital to tell him that it was actually the ghost who has saved her life. Bhavani's father then tries to see if the ghost is actually trying to protect Siddharth. When the ghost appears as expected, her father begs her to come home with him, but she continues to remain at the apartment. Siddharth understands that Bhavani's spirit never meant him any harm.
Realizing that the only way Bhavani can rest in peace is by bringing her killer to face justice, Siddharth and his friends attempt to solve the mystery of her death themselves. They track down the auto driver that helped Siddharth save Bhavani and he tells them that he saw a green car driving away after the accident. They then manage to track down the green car at a shady workshop. The driver turns out to be a young man who stole an orphaned child from the hospital, since he and his wife cannot have children of their own. The driver's cousin, who was in the car that day tells Siddharth that she saw the actual car that hit Bhavani that day and that it was not green but red. Siddharth then goes back to the auto driver and asks him to differentiate between red apples and green ones, which he cannot since he is colour blind.
Finally realising that he is the killer, Siddharth goes to tell Bhavani's father the truth. The ghost tries to stop him, but he still reveals the truth. Over-ridden with guilt, Siddharth tries to commit suicide. Bhavani's spirit saves Siddharth from committing suicide by cremating her own body that her father had preserved all this time in the ice, thus moving on to the next world. Bhavani's father comforts Siddharth by saying that he is a very kind hearted person and he would have never done that intentionally and that is why his daughter fell in love with him and stayed with him.",6.6

2014,Meaghamann,Tamil,Magizh Thirumeni,"Arya, Hansika Motwani, Sudhanshu Pandey",action drama,"The story begins in Goa where six dead bodies are washed ashore. The Goa Drug Lord, Jothi (Ashutosh Rana) is responsible for this. The Police Department of India are unable to capture him for nearly a decade, because not a single person has seen him in person and he is constantly on the move and also has no permanent aides or accomplices.
Chitti (Mahadevan) is in-charge for the drug trafficking in and around Goa. One day, he receives a call from Jothi about a missing drug consignment. Chitti and his men are unable to hunt down the culprit. It is revealed that Shiva (Arya), is the mastermind behind the drug theft. We see that Shiva is working for Chitti as his most trusted henchman. Chitti, along with Shiva and his nephew Guru (Harish Uthaman) run an underworld drug empire in Goa.
In a turn of events, we see that Shiva is actually Arul, an undercover police officer who is assigned to expose Jothi and his entire drug cartel. He receives instructions from his higher officers Bharathi (Anupama Kumar) and Benjamin Vas (O A K Sundar) and he also informs them about all the activities of his gang from time to time. Arul is into this mission along with his best friend and colleague Karthik (Ramana) who also takes a stage name as Maanik, and he works for Sharma (Ashish Vidyarthi), another drug lord from Mumbai, who is in possession of 1000 kg of pure heroin and is presently, looking for a buyer.
The plan of Bharathi, Benjamin and their team is to make Sharma and Jothi meet each other for the transaction of the 1000 kg of heroin and then arrest them together. Arul informs Bharathi that initially Sharma and Jothi are planning for a trial with just 100 kg of heroin and that, if all goes well, they will deal with the remaining 900 kg. Bharathi and her team wisely plan to capture the huge bulk of 900 kg of drugs along with Sharma and Jothi. So they have to leave the first trial transaction unmonitored. However, all plans go awry when Bharathi's jealous boss does not agree to her plan and conducts a raid for the trial transaction in the last moment. This exposes the cop Karthik and he is taken to Chitti's place and tortured by Guru and his gang to reveal the identity of any other man working with him.
Unable to bear the pain, Karthik reveals that Arul is the other undercover officer. Guru informs Chitti about Arul's true identity and when they attempt to kill him, Arul guns down Chitti and starts eliminating all the gang members including Guru. Soon, Arul finds Karthik but within moments, Karthik dies.
Jothi is now aware of the death of Chitti and his entire crew and uses his influence to the police officers to bring Arul into his custody. So, the police force and Jothi's men join hands and hunt for Arul. Arul, now all alone on this mission, still continues his own plan to expose Jothi and gets himself captured on purpose. Now that he has nothing to lose, he plans to play a final game of chance to meet Jothi face to face and earn his trust and join as henchman again. Arul is the only survivor of the shootout at Chitti's place and so only his account to Jothi will earn his trust.
Arul is brought to Jothi for the first time and he is also able to cleverly convince him, but only up to an extent. He tells Jothi that his former partner-turned-archenemy Rane (Sudhanshu Pandey) is responsible for the drug theft (mentioned at the beginning), and shootout at Chitti's place. He says that all this while Jothi had been thinking that Rane was dead, but now he is actually alive is plotting his revenge. Jothi is still sceptical, so Arul is given 48 hours time to prove that Rane is alive and has done all these things. Arul succeeds by getting help from a prostitute (Sanjana Singh) whom he helped earlier. He also places all the stolen drugs at Rane's house and leads Jothi's men there, and they find the lost drugs. Jothi asks his men to kill Rane and his gang. Shiva cleverly does certain manipulations and kills Rane and his men and places his own guns in Rane's hands. This leads Jothi and his men to believe that Rane's gun and the one used in the shootout at Chitti's place are one and the same. The gun is also sent the gun for ballistic testing to check on Shiva's story and they all believe that Shiva's story is true.
Soon, Jothi asks Arul to join his gang and meet him at a secluded place. When Arul waits for the opportunity to gun down Jothi, he gets beaten up by his men. It is then revealed that Usha (Hansika Motwani), his neighbour who has a huge crush on him, had been secretly recording videos of him on her phone, for her to admire. But her phone is stolen and it falls into the hands of Jothi's men. They find whom Arul has been meeting and dealing with so far and they come to know that he is also an undercover cop. As a result, Arul's bosses Bharathi and Benjamin are assassinated by Jothi's men. Jothi and his men then beat Arul savagely and keep him bound in a harbour and ask him the whereabouts of Sharma's remaining 900 kg of heroin. Arul whispers the location and as Jothi comes closer to hear him, Arul spits out a blade at Jothi's eye. When all his men are distracted momentarily, Arul escapes from his captors and kills them leaving Jothi alone and arrests him. Since nobody alive has seen Jothi in person, his arrest is unavoidable and no political influence will work out anymore.
As the credits roll, we see that Arul humbly rejects Usha's proposal and asks her to focus on her life. Arul then moves on to his next mission and kills Sharma and seizes the remaining 900 kg of heroin.",4.8

More events from the dream are followed by similar events in reality as Vicky falls in love with Divya (Deepa Sannidhi) who is a model in the dream and a waitress in reality.
In the dream, Vignesh and Divya hit it off easily at the beginning but later friction arises when Vignesh expresses his discontent on Divya working in film industry. Meanwhile, in reality, Vicky struggles to win Divya's heart, who rejects him first due to his low salary and falls later for his humble character. Divya's attempts to get Vicky educated and lead him to earn a better job turns out to be futile and also results in death of Durai in the hands of goons. Frustrated, Vicky chooses to leave Divya and continue to work in the theatre, despite the threats. Vicky and his foreign friends redecorate the theatre and release Durai's film to the audience. He later reconciles with Divya, who agrees to marry him.

When Srini reaches the astrologer's residence, he finds him dead.
Some time later, the friends are curious to know the story behind De Monte Colony, so Raghavan narrates the story. Years ago, the area was a colony of the Portuguese business tycoon Lord John De Monte, who owned almost half of Chennai. He wishes to gift his wife, so he orders a special necklace as a gift for his wife's birthday. Soon after his wife becomes mentally ill. He informs the situation to his son via mail, and consequently learns about the death of his son. A depressed De Monte wants to return to Portugal and travels to Calcutta to sell his properties in India before leaving.
When De Monte returns after five months, he learns that some orderly working in the house has raped his wife, leaving her pregnant. He further requests a doctor to treat his wife within the confines of the house, but the doctor refuses, citing hospital laws. Taking this as a mark of disrespect, De Monte kills the doctor and all his servants over lingering doubts as to who had raped his wife. Angered by this, the locals set fire to the house and a disturbed De Monte shoots what seems to be gas cylinders; the ensuing explosion kills everyone within the house including De Monte. Seemingly, a curse is set on the diamond necklace such that whoever tries to steal it will be killed, and the stolen necklace will return to De Monte's house in any way.
Raghavan reveals that he had stolen the necklace in the hopes that it could be sold for money. Eerie things begin to happen in their room — the TV does not switch off and, instead of the DVD that they had inserted, plays their own conversations where the death scenes were played. The power goes off, Srini contacts the electricity board for power help. Srini then adds about what happened to the astrologer. They play the call record, in which the astrologer reveals that Sajith has already died the last night. They all turn towards Sajith who is still sleeping.
The windows and doors do not open; the friends' cries for help are never heard outside. They take an ouija and ask some dreadful questions, then realise that no-one will return alive. One by one they turn up dead with Raghavan dying first and Vimal next. Srini suddenly discovers out a way to escape the room and runs towards a nearby tea shop, only to find that no-one can hear him; he realises he has become a ghost after dying when he attempted to jump out of the flat. Later, he witness the necklace being carried by Sajith, returning to the De Monte Colony House.",6.9

Massu meets Manini (Nayantara), a nurse and they subsequently fall in love. While trying to escape after a heist gone wrong, Massu and Jet meet with a car accident, post which Massu starts seeing dead people, with whom he can communicate. Jettu had died in the accident and is now a ghost, too. Massu forms a group of loitering ghosts to earn money by performing fake exorcisms and extorting money from scared rich people, while promising the ghosts that he would fulfill their last wishes in return. Meanwhile, Manini who thought Massu was working in a finance company gets to know about the fake exorcisms and leaves him in a heist.
One day he meets a ghost called Shakthi (also Suriya), a Sri Lankan Tamil and look-alike of Massu. Shakthi initially seems to help Massu to pull off a large heist. However, he wants to use Massu for his own needs. He sabotages the plan and tricks Massu into running over Anthony (Sharath Lohitashwa), a hawala broker. Corrupt Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Vikram Lakshman (Parthiban) takes charge to investigate the case and finds out that Massu is, somehow involved in the murder. Meanwhile, the ghosts start striking against Massu as they assume that he would cheat them. Massu yells at them and orders them to go out. Just then, Shakti arrives as the ghosts have called him. The ghosts go with Shakthi. But Jettu manages to convince Massu and he agrees to fulfill the wishes of the ghosts. He starts fulfilling the wishes of all the ghosts. He first fulfills the wish of the ghost of a woman, Padma which is to see her son, who is actually blind. Massu is frustrated to learn that he is accidentally responsible for the death of Padma. As a sort of seeking forgiveness, he guides her son, takes care of him and gets his eye operated upon. Her wish fulfilled, Padma attains salvation. This incident moves Massu and he fulfills the wish of every ghost. Meanwhile, Shakthi manages to use Massu to kill another person, Madhivadhanan aka Madhi, an MLA and associate of Anthony. While Massu is furious with Shakthi for having made him a double murderer, Kamal meets Massu and starts telling him Shakthi's past: Massu is Shakthi's son.

Shakthi secretly learns that Anu really loves and takes care of Megha. Anu & Shakthi fall in love. Anu gives birth to a son. Anu owned land in India, which she wanted to donate to an orphanage so that a new orphanage could be built there. Kamal was the only friend of Anu in India and agreed to help with the registration. Sakthi and Anu, along with their little daughter Megha (Yuvina Parthavi) and infant Massu, came to India to complete the registration but get to know that industrialists Radha Krishnan (Samuthirakani) and Anthony forged documents and planned to take the land away to construct flats there. Since Shakthi remained undeterred and did not give way, Radha Krishnan, Anthony and their henchman Madhi and Shanmuga Sundaram, killed Shakthi, Anu and Megha and pinned the murders on Kamal. Massu had escaped because Megha had left him safe in a small house with a family nearby.
Shakthi through Massu wanted to kill all the people who were responsible for his family's demise. Knowing the truth, Massu decides to kill the last person, Radha Krishnan, himself. Radha Krishnan also knows who Massu is and tries to kill him but Kamal saves Massu. However, because he was hit on the head by Radha Krishnan, he loses the ability to see and converse with the spirits anymore. With the help of Vikram, who double-crossed Radha Krishnan, Massu finally kills Radha Krishnan. As Shakthi's last wish is fulfilled, he goes to heaven and joins with Anu and Megha. Manini now reunites with Massu and they get married as Jettu remains with Massu forever.",6
2015,Kaaka Muttai,Tamil,M. Manikandan,"Vignesh, Ramesh, Aishwarya Rajesh",comedy drama,"In a tiny concrete-and-tin Chennai home in the slums live two young brothers with their mother and grandmother. With the boys' father in prison for unknown reasons and with an ageing mother-in-law, the mother does her best to keep the kitchen fires burning. The brothers spend their time playing games and stealing and devouring eggs from crows' nests. Their love for these eggs leads them to start calling themselves ""Periya Kaaka Muttai"" ( Big Crow Egg) and ""Chinna Kaaka Muttai"" (Small Crow Egg).
The young boys constantly beg their mother and grandmother for toys they cannot afford, and later for a television. They don't yet understand that the two women can't give them everything they want. When their mother and grandmother finally do bring home a television – a gift from the government to ration card holders who live below the poverty line – it's like the opening of a portal. The boys see a pizza commercial on TV whose steaming, slow-motion images make the unfamiliar food look like manna from heaven. Meanwhile, a brand new pizzeria comes up in the neighbourhood, and actor Silambarasan alias Simbu comes to its opening. Remembering the looks of enjoyment on Simbu's face when he tasted a pizza at the pizzeria, the boys thereafter think of nothing else but getting their first taste of a pizza.
The brothers go to the railway tracks each morning to collect the charcoal that falls off goods trains. They sell the charcoal at a scrap metal shop and are paid for their trouble. They usually hand the money over to their mother who is saving up to pay their lawyer to get her husband out of jail. But once the boys become aware of the cost of a pizza, they begin saving the money for themselves instead, lying to their mother that they have not collected any charcoal since they were out playing.
The boys succeed in saving the ₹ 300 required to buy a pizza, but are shooed away by the watchman of the pizza shop since they are badly dressed, which reflects the fact that they are local slum-dwellers. The boys narrate this story to their friend Pazharasam who works as a lineman with the Railways. He tells them that people place a lot of importance on clothes and advises them to save up and purchase new dresses before approaching the pizza outlet again.
The boys go on to work again to save money for buying new clothes at Chennai Citi Centre. In the meantime, they show their grandmother the pamphlet from the pizza shop. She tries to make them a home-cooked pizza using dosa batter as base, but the boys deride her attempts and insult her.
After finally saving up enough money for new dresses when the boys see Citi Centre, they realise that it is another big mall which would definitely not allow them inside. But they somehow manage to acquire a newly bought pair of clothes from a couple of rich children by buying them panipuri from a street vendor, much against the wishes of the rich boys' father, who had denied them the treat as he considered it unhygienic.
The happy brothers return to the pizza shop in their new dresses. Another group of slum boys who are envious and sceptical about the brothers' story about going to eat pizza follows them to take a video of what transpires with the brothers at the pizza shop. The brothers are once again confronted by the watchman and he now forces them to go home right away but the boys protest by saying that they have money and are wearing new clothes. This argument attracts the attention of the pizzeria supervisor who comes out and slaps the older brother. This is caught on video by the other slum kids who laugh at the brothers' humiliation.
The sad and disappointed brothers return to their slum only to be further overwhelmed by the miserable sight of their dead grandmother. The brothers feel guilty when they remember insulting their grandmother some time before.
When two men in the slum happen to watch the video of the boy being slapped, they try to make money by threatening the owner of the pizza shop to release the video to the media. The owner realises he could be imprisoned and his pizzeria sealed by the government due to his supervisor's act of discrimination and violence against slum children. He offers one of the men a hundred thousand rupees for not making the video public. The man agrees, but his associate releases it to the media hoping to make some money (unaware of the huge sum being offered). This stirs up tension amongst the pizzeria's owners who finally decide to publicly apologise to the slum kids.
The boys are welcomed to the pizza spot in a red carpet reminiscent of Simbu being welcomed in the opening ceremony of the pizzeria. The owner also promises them free pizzas for life. Even as the brothers begin to finally enjoy their first pizza, they tell each other that the dosa-pizza which their grandmother had earlier made for them had tasted much better.",4.8

2015,Indru Netru Naalai,Tamil,Ravi Kumar R.,"Vishnu, Miya, Karunakaran",science-fiction comedy,"In the year 2065, a scientist (Arya) invents a time machine. To prove its capability, he sends it back in time to 2015, programming it to return within forty seconds. However, the machine does not return.
The time machine is seen by three people in 2015 — Elango (Vishnu), a budding entrepreneur whose ideas are rejected by all and who is struggling to maintain his relationship with his rich girlfriend Anu (Miya), who is embarrassed at the fact that Elango is unemployed; Elango's best friend Pulivetti Arumugam (Karunakaran), a fake astrologer; and an inventor Giridhara Parthasarathy (T. M. Karthik), who makes a living by repairing home appliances. The three of them are involved in an accident and witness the time machine while recovering from the shock. While Parthasarathy decides to keep the time machine for himself, he suffers an electric shock and ends up in a coma, prompting Elango and Arumugam to steal the time machine from Parthasarathy's shop. The duo use the time machine to make Arumugam's astrology practice extremely successful by going back in time and finding things lost by people under the guise of astrology. Elango further uses the machine to impress Anu's industrialist father Rajarathinam (Jayaprakash) by going to the future, obtaining the stock market results and successfully ""predicting"" them in front of Rajarathinam and his company's board of directors. Rajarathinam soon approves the marriage of Anu with Elango.
Things go smoothly until Elango and Arumugam inadvertently thwart an encounter to kill Kuzhandaivelu (P. Ravi Shankar), a dreaded gangster and extortionist who is targeting Rajarathinam, during one of their trips to the past to find yet another item of one of Arumugam's clients. In the present day, Kuzhandaivelu is plotting to kill Rajarathinam for his role in planning the encounter and also Elango and Arumugam for (unknowingly) attacking him in a parking lot. Elango and Anu's marriage is postponed indefinitely as a result.
Elango and Arumugam go back to the past to fix their mistake, but Kuzhandaivelu accidentally shoots the time machine while fighting a police officer during the encounter, damaging it. The duo find Parthasarathy, who has woken up from his coma but doesn't remember them, and ask him to fix the time machine. While Parthasarathy manages to fix the time machine, due to a lack of specific parts which have not yet been developed, it can only take the user to a specific time in the past (when Kuzhandaivelu damaged the time machine) and also as the date cannot be changed, the user cannot return to the future. Therefore, the duo decide not to use it. Later, Kuzhandaivelu spots Elango, Arumugam and Anu at a mall and pursues them. He opens fire during the chase, killing Anu. To ensure that Anu remains alive, Elango decides to use the time machine to return to the past and kill Kuzhandaivelu, even though he cannot return. But Kuzhandaivelu spots the duo and while fighting them, all three of them fall into the time machine and go to the past. In the past, Kuzhandaivelu destroys the time machine, but Elango manages to kill Kuzhandaivelu. Then, Elango and Arumugam stop themselves from finding the time machine by thwarting the accident involving them and Parthasarathy.
The next morning, Elango wakes up in a bed, remembering only the events of the previous night. He soon finds out, to his surprise, that he is in a marriage hall and that he is getting married to Anu on that day. He does not remember, to Anu's bewilderment, any of the events which had occurred in the past two months as a result of his usage of the time machine during that period. He finds out that, without finding the time machine, he got a job and managed to impress Rajarathinam with one of his business ideas, leading to his marriage with Anu. Arumugam, who also doesn't remember anything over the past two months, is happily married. Elango and Arumugam soon find out that Kuzhandaivelu had died two months ago. They also run into Parthasarathy, who does not recognise them as they had never met.

Saga (Aadhi), a regular, middle-class college student from Chennai arrives in Mumbai to meet Mudaliar, the city's underworld don and protector of the poor. At around the same time, Mudaliar is rushed to the hospital after he is almost killed in an assassination attempt. A mob assembles before his house and demands he show up to prove he is alive. When he finally does appear, the crowd is grateful for his survival and pray for his well-being.
Saga and his three wealthy friends purposely skip their finals so that they can continue to stay in college and enjoy themselves rather than face adulthood. Despite being warned by his parents to stay away from his friends as they are a bad influence on him, Saga hangs out with them. He finally decides to turn over a new leaf after Kayal (Nikki Galrani), the girl he falls in love with, convinces his father that Saga can be a responsible adult if given the chance. His parents then put him in charge of his sister's wedding arrangements before leaving for their hometown to meet relatives.
With his family out of town, Saga follows his three friends for a night in the city to celebrate New Year's Eve. At a restaurant, two of his friends are drunk and get into a fight with a girl named Priya and her boyfriend, Surya. When the police come to resolve the ruckus, they realise that Saga's third friend is the son of the police commissioner and decides to arrest Surya instead. Priya protests and is publicly humiliated by the police inspector, without knowing who she is. She then warns Saga and his friends to go into hiding as they will not live to see the light of day.
By midnight, Saga and his friends come to know that Priya is actually the daughter of Mudaliar. Her brother, Guna, who runs Mudaliar's businesses in Chennai is after them for revenge. Saga's friends try to convince him to follow them into hiding as arranged by their wealthy and influential fathers, but he insists on staying to arrange for his sister's wedding. Later that morning, Saga is chased down by Guna's men while in town. He is finally saved by Deva, Guna's henchman who realises that Saga saved his brother's life once. Deva advises Saga to go to Mumbai to meet Mudaliar in person and explain everything since he is a sensible man, unlike Guna.
Saga goes to Mudaliar's home and claims that Guna sent him. When it is discovered he is lying, he is tortured since he is suspected for the assassination attempt on Mudaliar. Saga finally gets to meet Mudaliar and explains the truth of what happened that night in Chennai. However, Mudaliar drops a bombshell by saying that after Priya bailed out Surya from the police station that night, both of them went missing and have not been seen since. Since Saga and his friends were the last to see the couple alive, they are the prime suspects. Saga refuses to reveal his friends' whereabouts until Mudaliar threatens to have his family killed. Mudaliar then gives Saga some time to find his friends or else his family will die.
With Kayal and Deva's help, Saga finds out where his friends are hiding. In between, Saga is being attacked by a person in a purdah. As Saga cannot see his face, he is unable to catch his attacker. Saga goes into hiding as he suspects that he is being targeted by the father of one of his friends, in order to keep their identities safe. The attacker then tries to kill Deva and runs away. In the process, he begins to suspect that their fathers are trying to frame him for Priya's disappearance to save their sons. This forces Saga to reveal his friends' hideouts to Mudaliar, who releases his family. Saga then visits Deva in the hospital who is receiving treatment. Deva hands Saga a paper that has a symbol and says the attacker had this symbol tattooed in his hand. After much thinking, Saga realises that he saw such a tattoo on Surya's forearm and he might know about Priya's whereabouts and goes to his flat. Once there, he finds Surya's frozen body being kept by Surya's psychotic ex-girlfriend, Nila who also has the same tattoo on her hand. It is then revealed that she killed both Surya and Priya on New Year's Eve out of jealousy. Before Saga can take Nila to meet Mudaliar, she is killed by Deva's brother, leaving Saga with no alternative to convince the don of the truth. At around the same time, Mudaliar and Guna find Priya's body washed up on the beach.
Once his men have rounded up Saga and his friends, Mudaliar orders Guna and their men to kill them. However, the friend who tried to hit on Priya and caused the whole misunderstanding finally admits his mistake to Mudaliar and pleads for his friends' release in return for his life.

2015,Baahubali: The Beginning,Tamil,S. S. Rajamouli,"Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty, Tamannaah",epic / history,"In the ancient kingdom of Mahishmati, a woman carrying a baby falls into a waterfall and breathes her last, but before dying, she holds the baby in one hand above her head. The baby is rescued by local villagers and adopted by Sanga (Rohini) and her husband. Named Shivudu, (Prabhas) he grows up to be a strong, adventurous young man who is curious about the waterfall and the land beyond. After finding a wooden mask on the ground, he is driven to find the owner of the mask and succeeds in climbing the waterfall. The mask belongs to Avanthika (Tamannaah), a rebellious warrior of a group led by Devasena's brother engaged in guerrilla warfare against Emperor Bhallaladeva (Rana Daggubati) of Mahishmati to rescue their former queen Devasena (Anushka Shetty). Avantika is given the opportunity to rescue the queen. She falls in love with Shivudu after finding out that he climbed the waterfall for her. Shivudu pledges to help her in her mission and sneaks into Mahishmati to rescue Devasena.
Sivudu manages to flee with Devasena, but is chased down by Bhallaladeva's son, Bhadrudu (Adivi Sesh) and the slave-soldier Kattappa (Sathyaraj). After Shivudu beheads Bhadrudu, Kattappa drops his weapon, realising that Shivudu is Mahendra Baahubali, the son of late king Amarendra Baahubali. He narrates the story of Amarendra's past. Amarendra's father had died long ago, while his mother died giving birth to him. His uncle Bijjaladeva (Nassar) was deemed unfit to rule due to his crooked nature, however he believes he was denied the throne due to the fact that one of his arms is disabled. Bijjaladeva's wife Sivagami assumed control of the kingdom with Kattappa's assistance until a new king could be selected. Amarendra was brought up together with Bijjaladeva and Sivagami's son Bhallaladeva. Both young men were trained in arts, science, disguise, politics, and warfare, but they had different approaches towards kingship. While Amarendra was gracious and loved his countrymen, Bhallaladeva was violent and achieved his goals by any means possible.
It was then discovered that Mahishmati was about to be attacked by an army of savages called Kalakeyas. Bijjaladeva proposed that the prince who killed the Kalakeya king Inkoshi would be the future king of Mahishmati to which Sivagami and the chief minister agrees. Inkoshi rejected Sivagami's offer of peace and insulted her by saying he will have children with her. An enraged Sivagami ordered that his limbs be chopped off and body fed to the vultures. While Bhallaladeva used sophiscated weapons given by Bijjaladeva, Amarendra used simple yet effective tactics. As Amarendra was about to slay the king, Bhallaladeva swung his weapon from a distance and killed him. Sivagami announced Amarendra as the new emperor despite Bhallaladeva killing the king because of the fact that he shielded and protected his own countrymen throughout the war.
When asked about Amarendra's current whereabouts, a tearful Kattappa reveals that Amarendra is dead, and that he is the one who killed him.",7.9

While they are waiting in the party office for the leader to come in, they witness a murder of a rebel party candidate by their own revered leader due to caste-related comments by the rebel on him. When the leader asks Sengalvarayan to take the blame by saying that he killed the man due to rage about the rebel's comments, Pazhani volunteers to take the blame and is willing to go to jail, citing the leniency of juvenile laws in exchange for an MLA seat for his father in the upcoming by-election.
15 years later, trainee IPS officers Mithran, Shakthi, Suraj, Kathiresan and Janardhan ""Jana"", discreetly assist the police in catching a gang which kidnapped four girls. One day Mithran receives a cryptic text message on his phone from an anonymous number stating that he/she is aware of their discreet activities. In the evening, they go out to meet that person who is revealed to be Mahima (Nayantara), who loves Mithran. Later that same night they happen to witness the murder of a man named Ramar who is a social activist with the pretense of snatch theft. Mithran and his friend catch the gang and their leader and hand them over to the police; however, four days later the leader of the gang comes to the IPS headquarters with the home minister. This political and organised crime comes as a shock to Mithran and his friends. Mithran takes them to his house and shows his research on connecting all small unrelated incidents into the global view of a hidden network of politicians, industrialists and criminals who bend the law for their own financial benefits. He singles out three prominent business oligarchs (a pharmaceutical mogul, a mineral magnate and a don). When he tries following one he realizes that all three of them work as a group and they all work for a wealthy and influential scientist Siddharth Abhimanyu. After the completion of his training, Mithran is awarded medals for specializing in dealing with organized crime during training and also for being the best probationer of the batch, and is posted as the ASP of the Organized Crime Unit.
Mithran discovers that Siddharth is Sengalvarayan's son Pazhani. After his release from prison, Pazhani had his name changed and left India to complete his education abroad. After his graduation, he returned to India and is now a well-established scientist. Siddarth uses the medical field for the wrong reasons and his own profit. Sengalvarayan is now the incumbent health and welfare minister in the minority government headed by the party leader. At that time Angelina, a Swiss pharmaceutical company owner and activist tries to make generic medicines for life-threatening diseases available in India at low cost affordable by poor people. Siddharth's assassin kills Angelina before she can sign the agreement document with the government and shoots Mithran at the same time. While he is recovering from the gunshot wound in the hospital, an electronic bug (GPS + audio transmitter) is implanted during surgery. Through the bug, Siddharth listens to all of Mithran's plans and continuously monitors his whereabouts and whatever he talks via an audio transmission. Then comes evidence against Siddharth in the form of Manimekalai (Abhinaya). She was a scientist at Siddharth's research lab, where a seaweed that can cure diabetes is found abundantly in the oceans. Siddharth tries to sell the technology and rights to extract medicine from the seaweed to multinational pharmaceutical companies but is opposed by Manimekalai. So Siddharth arranges goons and the goons rape and kill her. But before being killed, she records a video and stores it in an SD card so that someone will find it. But before Mithran can find the card, Siddharth finds out and assigns Vicky (Vamsi Krishna) to recover the card, but Mithran tells Jana to get the card. He successfully gets the card after a fight with Vicky, but through the bug, Siddharth knows this and kills Jana. Mithran comes back to his special house where he finds a pin has been changed in a picture which turns out to be the picture of Ananya who was Miss World 2011 and a close acquaintance of Siddharth whose girlfriend Shilpa (Mugdha Godse) was also part of that event. Mithran doubts whether Siddharth himself would have come to his house. Mahima checks the fingerprints on the pin keeping the gun case Mithran received from Siddharth in his posting ceremony and the fingerprints match. A flashback reveals that Siddharth killed Shilpa's father so that she would not participate in the competition and as she will not have a ticket to go to her father's funeral he offers to take her in his chartered flight and wins her over. Mithran frantically searches for the bug which he eventually finds out and removes.
Mithran captures Vicky and records all the information from him. He drugs Vicky and manipulates Siddharth into killing him. At the same time, Siddharth's father reads the changed medical report, which contains very good medical contracts for public welfare and multiple accusations against the CM. When Siddharth learns about this, he asks Sengalvarayan to pretend to have chest pains and move outside to hospital. The ruling party forces Sengalvarayan either to resign within 24 hours or he will be dismissed. Mithran appeals to the CM that he has evidence and wants to arrest Siddharth, and he is granted permission to do so. Hence Siddarth kills his father using his goons in an accident and forces the CM to stop actions against him or he will lie that the CM killed his father for personal vengeance. But the next day at his father's state funeral, Mithran arrests him on the CM's orders.
When Siddharth is arrested, Mithran tells him that the medicine was patented in Manimekalai's name (despite Siddarth being the inventor) and will be made as generic medicine instead of a patent-protected one. It is also revealed that Sengalvarayan is still alive, saved by Mishra and his gang and the public funeral held was for Jana. Mithran makes a deal that he would save Siddharth's life for information and evidence on all of his criminal associates and activities and gives him a bulletproof vest to fake his death during his transport to the court.
They also plan to take down the setup planned by various VIPs to kill Siddharth when one of them gets close to Siddharth, Mithran notices and pushes Siddharth back. To Mithran's surprise, Siddharth does not wear the vest and is fatally shot by Shilpa. Before dying, he tells Mithran that he hid all the evidence in an SD card in the bulletproof vest, adding that he had not done it for the nation but because Mithran had asked for it. The film then happily ends with the wedding of Mahima and Mithran. The last narration was narrated by Mithran on how he became a successful police officer in his life after solving the case (about a boy going to prison for a crime he committed) he read for the first time on the newspaper .",5.6

At a graveyard somewhere close to the temple a group of tantric practitioners capitalise on the Amman being made dormant to awaken evil spirits for black magic purposes. During the ritual they inadvertently release a demonic entity that they could not contain. The evil spirit then leaves the graveyard in the form of cloud and moves into the village. The village mendicant-holyman notices the evil spirit and chases after it, but could not prevent it from entering the titular palace. Being mute, his pleadings to warn the palace owner (Radha Ravi) is ignored. Later that night, the spirit attacks the owner who then falls and goes into a coma. His elder son Ramesh (Subbu Panchu), arrives with his wife Sandhya (Vinodhini Vaidyanathan) and their son Suresh (Nithin Manivannann). Together with them are his younger brother, Murali (Siddharth) and his fiancé Anitha (Trisha Krishnan). Devadas (Soori) arrives as well, in disguise as his father, Sandhu Bondu Naadimuthu (Soori) who was a doctor and had contact with the land owners.
One night the family driver (Raj Kapoor) is killed. after a few nights, Suresh does crazy things and says that someone is telling him to do so. Also Murali sees his father being elevated above the bed and gets scared. Anitha who also sees these things decides to call her brother, Ravi (Sundar C.). One night Ravi sees Suresh drowning and rescues him. He initially suspects Manju (Poonam Bajwa), who was hired by the family as a nurse for Murali's father, but he soon realizes it is not her since she has a different agenda. After that he sets up cameras around the house. A couple of nights later the elder brother goes missing and Ravi sees it. With the cameras he is able to identify the spirit that is causing havoc. Murali identifies her as Maya (Hansika Motwani), his younger sister.
Maya was loved by all, especially by her father and Murali. She was also the owner of Maya Granites shown in the song Maya Maya. On the day before her marriage, she eloped with one of the workers' son (Vaibhav Reddy) and the whole family was shocked and felt disgraced. Three years later in Bangalore, when Murali sees that she is pregnant, he passes the good news to his father and brother as they arrive to their house. Their father asks Maya to come back home to which she agrees. On the day she was supposed to arrive, Maya didn't show up, and Murali thought she had changed her mind. Later Ravi tells that it's not true. Maya and her husband got off a stop earlier since her elder brother wanted them to arrive home safely. While traveling in a Jeep on the way to their palace, Maya's husband was stabbed by the driver. After that he instructed Maya to go into hiding. But this plan failed when Maya's father arrived and told her to drink poison since she disgraced her family's name and status by marrying someone who belonged to a lower caste. Maya agrees to her father's words with a condition that her husband's life should be spared. After she drank the poison Maya's elder brother killed her husband in front of her which made Maya vow that she will end the male generation in her family, before her father chokes her to death. Ravi also tells that her primary target is Murali, since he told their father and elder brother about her whereabouts and also Suresh.

Their main goal is to get Anitha's blood and put some holy ink on her hair. They manage to get her blood when she is cutting an apple, and one of the assistants (Manobala) manages to put the ink before getting thrashed by Anitha/Maya. There Anitha goes to the house and tries to kill Murali and Suresh. However it fails and the priest manages to get Maya out of Anitha. Later Ravi and the priest decide to kill the spirit and the only way is to be possessed by the spirit and stab its own corpse. Ravi manages to do it and completes it but the priest gets chest pain and he tells Murali that their only hope is to go to the Amman Pooja that is happening in their village temple as Amman is their final hope. Murali and Suresh get there with Ravi possessed by Maya trying to stop them. When Ravi is about to kill Murali, Amman uses her powers and prevents Maya's spirit from killing Murali and Suresh.

Despite the very poor infrastructure, Prabhu/Adi manages to find talent in a roadside fish seller Madhi (Ritika Singh), who he notices while she is thrashing the judges during her sister's tournament.
Ignoring Madhi's elder sister Lakshmi (Mumtaz Sorcar) who has been boxing for 8 years, Prabhu offers to train Madhi for a few hours daily. But the two don't get along due to Prabhu's/Adi's ruthless training methods and Madhi's aggressive nature. As a result, Madhi intentionally loses a local match. Prabhu later asks Lakshmi and Madhi's parents, Saamikannu (Kaali Venkat) and Damayanthi (Baljinder Kaur), to send them to stay in hostel with him so their daughters can work hard on training. Madhi misunderstands him, but later regrets when she finds out that Prabhu has sold his bike to buy new training equipment for her. Madhi then dedicatedly starts training with Prabhu and develops feelings for him. On the day of a qualifying match, she reveals her feelings to Prabhu and he promptly rejects her. During the warm-up before the match, a now jealous Lakshmi injures Madhi's hand causing Madhi to lose. Angry, Prabhu thinks that Madhi lost intentionally again and throws her out of training camp.

The doctors find the required antidote and start converting the zombies back to humans.

He takes up a case involving the rape and subsequent death of an IT employee Raji. He finds out that the rapist is Ashwin, the son of Labour Minister Vanamaamalai (J. Mahendran). Vijay kills Ashwin and reveals himself as the murderer to Vanamaamalai, who swears to take revenge on him for killing his son. Meanwhile, Vijay falls in love with a medical student Mithra (Samantha Ruth Prabhu) and both eventually get married and lead a happy life. But, Vijay's happiness is short-lived as Vanamaamalai, his younger brother Ratnam (Azhagam Perumal) and their henchmen barge into his house one night and kill Mithra and Vijay's mother (Raadhika). They even brutally assault Vijay and attempt to drown Vijay's baby daughter Niveditha aka Nivi in the bathtub. The dying Mithra manages to rescue Nivi and asks Vijay to take care of her, but not before making him promise that he will quit the police and be a peaceful and loving father to Nivi, following which she dies in Vijay's arms. Vijay fakes his death, changes his name to Joseph Kuruvilla and moves to Kerala with Nivi and his constable friend Rajendran (Rajendran) to protect Nivi from Vanamaamalai and his gang.
Five years later, Vijay is leading a happy life in Kerala with Nivi (Baby Nainika), who is now in kindergarten, and is running a bakery with Rajendran. As per Mithra's dying wish, he gave up violence and raises Nivi to be non-violent. He meets Annie (Amy Jackson), Nivi's class teacher, and both become good friends. Annie soon finds out about that Joseph is none other than the ""late"" Vijay Kumar, but Vijay warns her not to tell Nivi about it. One day, while Nivi is going on an excursion, the brakes of the school bus in which Nivi is travelling fails and the bus plunges into the backwater. Vijay, with the help of Annie, Rajendran and the local people, manages to rescue Nivi and the other children. He finds out that Vanamaamalai, who has found out that he and Nivi are still alive, is responsible for the bus plunging into the backwater in order to kill Nivi. Enraged, he decides to abandon his non-violent principles and destroy Vanamaamalai and his gang once and for all.
Vijay, posing himself as the ""ghost"" of Vijay Kumar, starts eliminating Vanamaamalai's henchmen one-by-one. He first kills an inspector Karikalan (Stun Siva), who is one of Vanamaamalai's henchmen and was present at the night when Mithra was killed. The police are baffled at the murder as it was done within the police station, and refuse to believe that Vijay committed the murder, since they think that he is dead. The ""mysterious deaths"" continue, with Vijay pushing Ratnam to his death from a high-storey building being constructed by him. Vanamaamalai is accused of killing Ratnam since both had fallen out, forcing him to go into hiding. Finally, Vijay allows himself to be captured by Vanamaamalai's henchmen in order to enter his hideout. After eliminating Vanamaamalai's henchmen, Vijay kills him. The police soon arrive at Vanamaamalai's hideout, only to see his dead body hanging from the ceiling, and with nobody else around, his murder also gets sensationalised in the media as a mysterious murder. It is soon revealed that the Chennai commissioner of police Sibi Chakravarthi (Prabhu Ganesan) is aware that Vijay is alive and secretly re-employs him in the police to reduce crime in Chennai in his ""ghost"" form, taking advantage of the fear the negative elements of the society have for Vijay, while publicly denying that he is still alive.

During a mass-marriage function organised by Jacket, 8 grooms and 1 bride out of the 25 couples to be married go missing due to the efforts of Jacket's arch-enemy, another MLA Maurdhamuthu (Aadukalam Naren). Murugan manages to get 7 grooms and 1 bride back, but 1 groom is still missing. To save Jacket's reputation, he asks his best friend Sakkarai (Soori) to pretend to marry the bride, Pushpa (Reshma Pasupuleti), the local dancer and item girl who is known to everyone in the village, despite his upcoming marriage to Hamsavali. Unfortunately for Sakkarai, the photo showing him tying the knot with Pushpa is published in the newspaper and goes viral on social media, forcing Hamsavali to break her engagement with Sakkarai unless he divorces Pushpa. Sakkarai asks Pushpa to sign the divorce notice, but she refuses to sign unless Jacket tells her to do so. To add to Sakkarai's woes, Pushpa even moves in with him.
Meanwhile, Murugan falls in love with Archana (Nikki Galrani), the daughter of the local tea shop owner whose main ambition is to become a police officer. Archana's father finds out about Murugan's close association with Jacket and asks him to give ₹10,00,000 to Jacket so that his daughter could become a sub-inspector and also asks him not to tell Archana as she wants to get the SI job in an honest way. Later that day, Jacket goes to hospital to visit a minister Shanmugasundaram (Vittal), who is on his deathbed. Before dying, Shanmugasundaram tells him about ₹500,00,00,000 that he acquired illegally, but wants him to use it for good purposes. This is heard by Jacket's brother-in-law Bhootham (Ravi Mariya), who also wants the money, but for his own benefit. He chases Jacket on his way home to find out the location where the money is kept, but Jacket meets with an accident during the chase and loses his memory, beginning to act like a 10-year old.
Archana eventually gets the SI job, but soon finds out that she got the job on merit. Thinking that Murugan had cheated her father, she immediately orders him to give back her father's money, failing which he would be thrown into prison. Murugan and Sakkarai find out that Jacket has lost his memory, but manage to get him discharged from the hospital. They train him to tell Archana that he has received the money from Murugan and to tell Pushpa to sign the divorce notice so that both their problems would be solved. But their plan backfires completely as Jacket tells Pushpa what he was supposed to tell Archana, making Pushpa realise that Jacket has lost his memory and refuses to sign the divorce notice again. Jacket also inadvertently gets caught in the middle of a protest against Marudhamuthu and is eventually kidnapped by Bhootham and his men. Murugan is caught at the scene of the kidnapping and is arrested by Archana.
At Bhootam's hideout, Jacket irritates him and his men with his childish behaviour. In a fit of rage, Bhootham kicks Jacket, making him unconscious. But Jacket regains his memory after gaining consciousness, much to Bhootham's happiness. Bhootham asks him to tell where the money is, but instead Jacket starts telling all the events leading up to the event where he met Shanmugasundaram in the hospital, and keeps repeating the story from the beginning if he is interrupted, much to his irritation. At this juncture, Murugan and Archana, who have both found out that Bhootham has kidnapped Jacket, arrive. Murugan manages to stop Jacket's repetition, getting him to tell in front of Archana that he indeed received money from Murugan, but since the DGP Sathasivam (Venkat), to whom he was supposed to pay the bribe, refused to accept the bribe, he gave the money to a contractor. Jacket also tells that he has managed to convince Pushpa to sign the divorce notice. He then reveals the location of the money to Bhootham, which is stored in an abandoned mansion. Murugan, Archana, Sakkarai, Jacket, Bhootham and even Marudhamuthu, who has also found out about the money, go to the mansion. A fight ensues between Murugan, Archana, Sakkarai and Jacket on one side and Bhootham and Marudhamuthu on the other side over the money, which ends with the former successfully getting the money.
In the end, with all problems solved, Murugan and Archana enter into a romantic relationship, while Sakkarai is to get married to Hamsavali during another mass-marriage function organised by Jacket.

He immediately resumes charge of his old gang and soon confronts Loganathan alias Loga (Mime Gopi), a drug smuggler. Loga insults Kumudha, saying that she would have been sold into prostitution had she been alive. In retaliation, Kabali rams his car into Loga, killing him; however, the incident makes him believe that his wife may be still alive. Later, Kabali survives an assassination attempt by Tamizh Kumaran alias Kumaran (Kalaiyarasan), whose father Tamilmaaran (Charles Vinoth) was killed by Kabali when Kumaran was a young boy. The next day, at a function organised by the Free Life Foundation School, a school started by Kabali's friend Ameer (John Vijay) to reform youngsters involved in criminal activities, Kabali talks about his past.
Kabali was the protege of Tamilmaaran's father Tamilnesan (Nassar), a don who fought for the rights of the Tamil Malaysians. Tamilnesan was killed by Veerasekaran alias Veera (Kishore), who was also a part of Tamilnesan's gang, but disliked his rules such as not involving in illegal activities like drug smuggling and prostitution. Following Tamilnesan's death, Kabali took charge of Tamilnesan's gang. But Veera manipulated Tamilmaaran by telling him that he, being Tamilnesan's son, should lead the gang and not Kabali. Tamilmaaran invited Kabali and a pregnant Kumudha for a temple function. However, this was revealed to be a trap as Veera and his men confronted Kabali and Kumudha at the function. In the ensuing scuffle, Kabali was brutally attacked while Kumudha was shot and seemingly killed. Kabali then killed Tamilmaaran for his betrayal in front of a young Kumaran and was soon arrested on a false charge of instigating the massacre.
Kumaran, after hearing Kabali's speech, realises his mistake and apologises to him. He tells him that Velu (R. Amarendran), one of Veera's henchmen who was present at the temple massacre, is aware of what happened to Kumudha. Kabali then leaves for Thailand, where Velu is residing.

At this juncture, Kabali is confronted by Yogi (Dhansika), a contract killer hired by Veera and his boss Tony Lee alias Tony (Winston Chao), who heads the rival Gang 43 in Kuala Lumpur, to eliminate Kabali. But Yogi instead kills the men who had come with her and reveals herself to Kabali as his daughter, who had been raised by Velu. She also tells him that Kumudha is still alive and is living with a French family in Puducherry. Kabali and Yogi then leave for Puducherry, where, after several days of searching, they reunite with Kumudha and spend a few days with her there. While in Puducherry, Kabali and his family are attacked by men sent by Tony. However, Kabali and Yogi fight them off and escape safely with Kumudha.
Kabali and his family soon return to Kuala Lumpur, where he is told that Ameer has been severely injured in a car accident set up by Tony; his henchman Jeeva (Dinesh) was brutally chopped to pieces by Tony after refusing to join the Gang 43; and the Gang 43 had destroyed the Free Life Foundation School and started to control the Kuala Lumpur underworld, eliminating any gang who dared to oppose them.

Later, the bus in which Khanum was travelling was burnt by protestors just a few kilometres from the border, however Khanum managed to survive. Vasu took her to her home in PoK safely via an unguarded border crossing, but was soon caught by the Pakistan Army for infiltrating into their country and imprisoned.
In the present day, Vasu finds out that along with him, twenty-three other BSF jawans are held prisoner by the Pakistan Army. One day, he is made to fight one of the imprisoned BSF jawans (Ajay Rathnam). He manages to defeat the jawan, but is then taken to a nearby cliff by the Pakistan Army to be shot. However, a sympathetic Pakistan Army officer, whose daughter's illness was successfully treated by Indian doctors, secretly allows him to escape. Vasu goes to Khanum's village, where he witnesses Khanum's family being killed by a cruel anti-Indian Pakistan Army commander Razzaq Ali Khan (Shaji Chaudhary), who feels that Khanum is a traitor for loving the Indian Vasu. Vasu rescues Khanum and both of them leave for the Indian border, with Razzaq and the Pakistan Army in pursuit. He manages to subdue the armymen as well as Razzaq, but chooses not to kill Razzaq. Razzaq, while accepting defeat, reveals that his opinion of India and Indians will not change. At this, Vasu forcefully replies that despite being an Indian, he does not hate Pakistan and Pakistanis and that the misguided hatred between the two countries only aggravates the India-Pakistan conflict.
The movie ends with Vasu revealing the presence of the twenty-three jawans in Pakistan and ensuring their freedom, for which he is honoured by the President as well as the Prime Minister of India.",8.1
2016,Dharma Durai,Tamil,Seenu Ramasamy,"Vijay Sethupathi, Tamannaah, Aishwarya Rajesh, Srushti Dange, Raadhika",romantic drama,"Dharmadurai (Vijay Sethupathi) is the village drunkard. His antics are a constant source of embarrassment for his brothers and brother-in-law, who run a chit-fund business. The brothers lock him up partially clothed in an empty outhouse most of the time and thrash him whenever he tries to stand up to them. The only people who sympathise with Dharmadurai are his mother Pandiyamma (Raadhika) and his close friend Gopalaswamy (Ganja Karuppu). One day, fed up of his antics, the brothers plot to kill him, however, Pandiyamma overhears her sons and helps Dharmadurai to escape from the outhouse in the middle of the night, advising him to leave the house for good and lead a good life far away from his brothers. With this in mind, Dharmadurai takes his old clothes and bag and leaves for Madurai. However, unknown to him, the bag contains the chit-fund money. When Dharmadurai's brothers find out that he and the money are missing the following morning, they begin a search for him, but give up eventually.
It is then revealed that Dharmadurai is a general doctor and was the first graduate from his village, having pursued his MBBS from Madurai Medical College. During his college days, he was part of a group of friends that included Subhashini (Tamannaah Bhatia) and Stella (Srushti Dange). Both of them were in love with Dharmadurai, and while Stella openly revealed her feelings for him, Subhashini kept her feelings to herself. He was influenced by one of his lecturers Dr. Kamaraj (Rajesh), who believed in serving the poor and helpless in the villages instead of running after money and foreign employment. Inspired by Dr. Kamaraj's ideas, the three friends decided to stay back in India after graduation, but they soon lost contact with each other. Badly requiring Stella's and Subhashini's support and guidance for his current troubles, Dharmadurai manages to get their current addresses from his old college. First, he goes to Stella's house, only to find out that she is no more, having lost her life in a car accident. Then, he goes to the hospital where Subhashini is working. Subhashini, who is now married to a Hyderabad-based doctor, is alarmed at the change in Dharmadurai. Dharmadurai tells her why he had become an alcoholic.
Following his graduation, Dharmadurai had returned to his village and had set up a clinic there. One day, he encountered Anbuselvi (Aishwarya Rajesh), a farm labourer who had brought some sick elderly village women to his clinic. He was immediately attracted to Anbuselvi and soon asked permission from her father Paraman (M. S. Bhaskar) to marry her, who agreed. Anbuselvi also agreed to marry Dharmadurai and their marriage was fixed. But Dharmadurai's brothers demanded 50-sovereigns gold ornaments and ₹5,00,000 as dowry from Paraman, who refused to accept their demand and called off the marriage. Heartbroken, Anbuselvi committed suicide. An enraged Dharmadurai, realising that his brothers were the cause of the end of his marriage and Anbuselvi's death, thrashed them mercilessly and was about to kill them, only to be stopped by Pandiyamma. Betrayed and heartbroken, Dharmadurai shut down his clinic and took to alcoholism.
Subhashini, after hearing Dharmadurai's story, takes him to her apartment and nurses him back to sobriety. Following Dharmadurai's recovery, Subhashini reveals to him that she has decided to divorce her husband as he had killed her unborn child, by mixing abortion pills, in the milk she consumed without her knowledge, when she was pregnant, since she had refused to abort the baby and move abroad with him to France as he had desired. She also adds that she is in love with him since their college days. Dharmadurai reciprocates Subhashini's feelings for him and the two enter a live-in relationship, after she divorces her husband. He also resumes his practice in that very town and soon becomes famous for his work towards the poor, helpless and downtrodden. One day, Dr. Kamaraj, who is blind now, upon hearing about Dharmadurai's work, visits him. On the advice of Dr. Kamaraj, he and Subhashini decide to get married. Subashini gets pregnant with Dharmadurai's child. Subhashini also advises him to return to his village, give back the money in bag to his brothers and also to tell them and mother Pandiyamma that he is going to get married. Dharmadurai agrees and visit back his village.
At his village, Dharmadurai learns that his family had to vacate their house as they were forced to sell it to compensate the villagers, who had found out that their money had been stolen. When he goes to the place where his mother and brothers are now living (a hut in the middle of a field), one of his brothers knocks him out with a spanner, enraged that he had brought them to poverty by stealing the chit fund money. But when he realizes that he had brought back the money, he repents his action. Pandiyamma rushes Dharmadurai to hospital, where he is treated by his batch mate, whom he had attacked in the college. While recuperating at the hospital, he gets a call from Subhashini, asking him to return as soon as possible, and that both Subhashini and the unborn baby are waiting for him.",7.5

On the downside the story the director keeps on establishing that the hero is seeing ghosts in scene after scene, thereby diluting the fear factor.

Ravi visits the hospital to pay the money for his treatment, but is told that the full amount for surgery will be ₹. 4,82,000 instead of ₹. 3,20,000 due to some miscellaneous charges.

2016,Iru Mugan,Tamil,Anand Shankar,"Vikram, Nayanthara, Nithya Menen",action,"An elderly Malaysian man suddenly goes ballistic and kills several Indian officers in a span of five minutes at the Indian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, before collapsing. A tattoo of a love symbol is present at the back of his neck, leading RAW officials to conclude that it is the handiwork of a criminal scientist named Love, whose identity and whereabouts are unknown to anyone except Akhilan Vinod (Vikram), a suspended RAW agent whose wife Meera George (Nayantara), a leading computer analyst at RAW, was killed by Love four years ago. RAW chief Malik (Nassar) tracks down Akhilan and convinces him to join the investigation. On viewing the video footage of the attack, Akhilan comes to the conclusion that the elderly Malaysian man had taken a mysterious performance-enhancing drug which allowed him to attack the Indian officials and decides to investigate the matter further in Malaysia. Since Akhilan is under suspension, Malik assigns him as a deputy to a junior RAW agent Aayushi (Nithya Menen), who is officially assigned to handle the case, and the two of them leave for Kuala Lumpur.
In Kuala Lumpur, Akhilan and Aayushi learn that the mysterious drug is inhaled using an asthma inhaler. Further investigations lead them to Peter (Karunakaran), a scientist who is on Love's payroll. Peter turns approver and tells them about the drug, which is called ""Speed"". The drug causes a person who inhales it to have extraordinary strength for five minutes before falling unconscious, and if the person inhales the drug again within a few hours, he/she will suffer a massive heart attack. Peter also reveals that a shipment of Speed inhalers is to be dispatched to Love within the next fifteen minutes. Akhilan and Aayushi pursue the lorry carrying the inhalers. But a lorry driver inhales Speed and subdue the duo, who are then taken to Love's hideout. As Akhilan moves to arrest Love (Vikram), who turns out to be transgender, he is knocked out by none other than Meera, who is shockingly still alive, has been working for Love as a computer hacker, and now goes by the name of Rosy. It is then revealed that Meera suffers from retrograde amnesia after being shot in the head four years ago and that Love took advantage of her situation to employ her as a computer hacker. She has no mind of her own, following whatever Love says. However, when Love orders her to kill Akhilan and Aayushi, she instead points the gun at Love, and calls the police, who arrest Love. Meera then reveals that she had been forced to take Speed by Love to work faster, but the drug caused her old memories, including those with Akhilan, to return, and she soon regained her full memory after continuous use of the drug.
Love manages to obtain a Speed inhaler while in custody and inhales it, helping her to escape and destroy the entire police station, killing everyone present including Aayushi. Akhilan finds out that Love had made a satellite call to Chang, the Transport Minister of Malaysia who had allowed Love to send shipments of Speed inhalers to India to perpetrate terror attacks there in return for money. He rushes to the hospital where Chang is admitted and interrogates him. During the interrogation, Love sneaks into the hospital and hiding in the AC vent, sprays a neurotoxic gas in Chang's room, causing Akhilan and Chang to get paralysed. She then kills Chang and puts the knife on Akhilan's hand, framing him as Chang's assassin. Now a wanted criminal, Akhilan, despite being paralysed, somehow manages to escape from the hospital and the Malaysian police.
Akhilan and Meera then decide to finish off Love once and for all using Love's kill switch activation device which had been restored and hidden by Aayushi before she was killed. However, as the device can only be opened with Love's fingerprint, they plan on obtaining her fingerprint. They sneak into an illegal airfield owned by Chang, where Love is planning to leave for India with the shipments of Speed inhalers. Akhilan inhales Speed and fights Love, who has also inhaled Speed, and manages to get her fingerprint before collapsing after the drug's effect wears off. On regaining consciousness, he finds out that Love has already left for India. He then uses the fingerprints to open the kill switch activation device, deactivates Meera's kill switch and kills all of Love's henchmen, including those piloting the plane. The plane crashes into a remote jungle, killing Love, destroying the Speed shipments and thus averting a major terrorist attack.
One month later, Akhilan and Meera are seen enjoying a holiday cruise sponsored by the Government of Malaysia as a reward for killing Love. After discussing their future plans, Akhilan reveals he has kept a Speed inhaler and inhales it.",6.3

The only other element in the room apart from the two of them is the dead body of a man lying in the middle of the room, blood soaked. Vishal and Dr.Vasudevan do not know each other. Soon, Vishal realises that there is a tape recorder near him, he finds a cassette in his pocket, which he plays. The cassette welcomes him to the SQUARE and tells him that his only way of escaping is by finding a clue that only the guy opposite him can see. Soon, Dr.Vasudevan plays the cassette from his pocket and the recording again welcomes him to the SQUARE and tells him that he has been doing a lot of good by saving lives as a Doctor and yet he has committed a grave mistake which he is now getting punished for. He is told that there is only 8 hours remaining for him to escape and his escape would only be by killing the one opposite him.
Vishal, unwilling to cooperate with Dr.Vasudevan cries, screams asking the kidnapper to let him go. Finally coming to terms with their capture, encouraged to think objectively by Dr.Vasudevan, Vishal gives in. They both start working together to find out ways to escape by charting the clues the kidnapper gives.
Meanwhile, on another plane, Siva, working in a multi-national company is told that he has been selected as the ""Employee of the Decade"" and will have to collect his coveted award from their Delhi Headquarters. He comes home to a good news that his wife – Dhivya (Suja Varunee), who is pregnant has conceived twin babies. Overly rejoiced, the couple celebrate their good luck.
As Dr.Vasudevan and Vishal discuss, recall and think, we uncover their personal lives. Dr.Vasudevan a reputed Doctor from a Government Medical Centre is married and has a teenage daughter. But he has an ongoing relationship with one of his trainee students – Dr.Preethi (Sanam Shetty) While he is honest for the most part of his professional life, he is threatened by another trainee student Dr. Shankar (Brihadish Kaushik) to re-write a Postmortem report of a rape victim in favour of the accused (an MP’s son). He is threatened with photos of him with Dr. Preethi. Scared, Dr. Vasudevan sells out.
Vishal on the other hand is a photographer who takes pictures of people in their intimate moments, mostly done on request by certain clients. One such assignment he was given by Dr. Shankar, to follow and take pictures of Dr.Vasudevan along with Dr.Preethi. Dr. Vasudevan gets shocked knowing Vishal already knows him and is partly the reason why he is in the SQUARE.
Meanwhile, Siva and his wife Dhivya prepare to leave to Delhi to receive his award and their flight meets with a tragic accident.
Back in the square, Dr.Vasudevan tells Vishal that a few months earlier a Lawyer was killed brutally in a similar fashion of the dead man in the middle of the room. He says he was suspected of that murder as he was the Lawyer who had demanded he change the Postmortem report. Although his innocence was proved, one CBCID Police officer Aadhi (Birla Bose) stills suspected Dr.Vasudevan.
Upon getting a certain lead, long after the case got over, Aadhi goes in search of the killer (then deemed Serial killer) sure that it was Dr.Vasudevan. The killer escapes from his clutches, in the process gravely injuring him, puncturing his vocal cord. Long after, Aadhi still tries to pin the whole case on Dr.Vasudevan hoping to catch him at his weakest.
Vishal and Dr.Vasudevan get suspicious that their kidnapper might be Dr.Shankar. Dr.Vasudevan comes to know that his wife and daughter have been kidnapped by him too, as a security measure in case Dr.Vasudevan tries to escape. Heart-broken and with no way out Dr.Vasudevan starts realising the value of his family. The love they have for him and the love he has for them.
We go back in time to see that Dhivya finds out that Siva is terminally ill and he has been undergoing treatment without telling her a word about it. She breaks down and cries. Siva tells her that not everyone gets the best in life. He asks her to appreciate what they’ve got in life.
CBCID Aadhi goes to Dr.Vasudevan’s office suspecting something. Inside, Dr.Shankar holds Dr.Vasudevan’s wife and daughter captive. They try to escape and hearing gunshot, Aadhi arrives at the spot. Shankar escapes from him and heads elsewhere.
Dr.Vasudevan, unable to wait for rescue any longer and losing patience decides to break free by cutting his leg free from the chain. Vishal tries to stop him. Dr. Vasudevan shoots Vishal like the kidnapper commanded earlier and breaks away to leave the square. Vishal regains consciousness and realises the Doctor had carefully shot him on his shoulder so as not to mortally injure him. He tries to escape when the dead body in his midst wakes up. It is Siva and he is the mastermind behind the whole square.
Siva who upon recovering from his flight accident, finds out about the girl’s rape and how the lawyer, Dr.Shankar and Dr.Vasudevan played their part in defending the convict. He realises that Vishal was instrumental in instigating this and spoiling several other lives by clicking pictures of their intimate moments. He decides to destroy all their lives. He kills the lawyer first, pushes Dr.Shankar to kidnap Vishal and Dr.Vasudevan and thereafter Dr.Vasudevan’s wife and kid. Dr. Shankar and Aadhi have a tough fight at the end of which Dr.Shankar kills Aadhi. He comes to the square to finish the two of them. But Vishal kills him in the process.
In the end, Siva wakes up from his act, tells Vishal that all he had to do was cooperate and work with Dr.Vasudevan to find his escape route which is written right on his back. Siva tells him that he has lost and he deserves to rot in the square. Siva leaves the square promising to return with others who don’t appreciate their lives.",5.6

However, his lack of acting out romantic scenes hinders his path to the dream, and is even rejected by director K. S. Ravikumar during the audition for his new film Avvai Shanmugi 2. He comes across Kavya (Keerthy Suresh), who is a doctor, and instantly falls in love with her. He goes to her house to propose his love, only to find out that she is engaged to a Pune-based doctor Vishwanathan alias Vishwa (Anson Paul). Siva, though distraught, decides to woo Kavya anyway and somehow break her engagement with Vishwa. He disguises himself as a nurse, going by the name of ""Remo"" (short for ""Regina Motwani"", a combination of the names of actresses Regina Cassandra and Hansika Motwani), and takes up a job in the same hospital where Kavya works.
Ensuring that Kavya never finds out his true identity, Siva as Remo establishes a close friendship with her, but is unable to convince her to end her engagement with Vishwa. Undeterred, he organises a massive surprise on her birthday and proposes to her as Siva. Kavya, who has been charmed by the surprise and fallen in love with Siva, is in a dilemma as she is unable to decide between Vishwa and Siva. Siva takes advantage of her dilemma and juggles the roles of both Siva as well as Remo with the aim of breaking her engagement, all the while hiding his dual identity from her. Eventually, Kavya gives in and admits her feelings to Siva, but, to the shock of both her and Siva, Vishwa has decided to prepone their marriage to the very next day.

Kavya tells her latest problem to him: Siva is still attracted to her and constantly calls her, despite her having changed her number 46 times.

He is influenced by the ideas of Chinnarasu (R. Parthiepan), a local Dalit leader who had also sponsored his education. Chinnarasu and Kittu try to fight against the rampant caste discrimination meted out to them by the upper caste people, but are unable to do much about it as the police and courts are biased towards the upper castes. One day, Kittu sees his classmate Gomathi (Sri Divya), who is from the upper caste, discriminate against a Dalit girl. He admonishes her publicly for her act of caste discrimination, which makes her repent her behaviour. Gomathi eventually falls in love with Kittu, but Kittu maintains a distance as they are from different castes, though he too is in love with her.
When the news spreads through the village that Gomathi is in love with Kittu, upper caste men kill Gomathi's father and frame Kittu, who is imprisoned, but is soon released on bail as there is no evidence that he had killed Gomathi's father. Kittu then assaults the village inspector Selvaraj (Harish Uthaman), who holds a grudge against the Dalits and was responsible for framing him for the death of Gomathi's father. In retribution, Selvaraj arrests Kittu and thrashes him mercilessly in the police station. Kittu does not return home the next morning, despite Selvaraj's pleas that he had released him, prompting the villagers to think that Selvaraj had killed Kittu while in custody as his hatred towards the Dalits is well known in the village. The Dalits led by Chinnarasu protest outside the police station, leading to Selvaraj's suspension.
However, it is then revealed that Kittu had not gone ""missing"" but is living in a tribal village near Kodaikanal as part of a plan hatched by Kittu and Chinnarasu to expose the upper caste men involved in the death of Gomathi's father, with Kittu deciding to return to the village after he is cleared of all involvement in the murder.

With the help of Deva (Soori), a local incompetent don, he succeeds in winning her heart. Divya's elder brother is Tamizhselvan (Jagapathi Babu), the honest and sincere DCP of Chennai. He approves the relationship between Arjun and his sister and soon their wedding is fixed. One day, Tamizhselvan is kidnapped by some goons in retaliation for his thwarting of a black money scam six months ago. Arjun rescues Tamizhselvan and takes him home, only to reveal that he is actually a CBI officer who had discovered ₹250 crore stashed in Tamizhselvan's house as black money. ₹300 crore had been seized during the black money raid, but it was publicly announced that only ₹50 crore had been seized. Arjun takes away all the money but does not arrest Tamizhselvan due to his public reputation, instead of telling him to personally surrender later that day.
However, Tamizhselvan soon finds out that Arjun is not a CBI officer from a terrorist, but is a criminal who had recently been released from prison. He pursues Arjun with the aim of getting back the money. During the chase, he opens fire on Arjun's SUV, causing Arjun to lose control and meet with an accident, losing consciousness. Arjun wakes up in a hospital, having lost his memory. Tamizhselvan keeps Arjun in custody in a house, where a psychiatrist Dr. Boothri (Vadivelu) is assigned to restore Arjun's memory so that he can reveal where he has kept the money. But, unknown to anyone, Arjun had not lost his memory; he is only pretending as part of his mission to retrieve the black money. At night, he sneaks out of the house and steals the black money of a Union Minister (Jayaprakash), converting it to white money with the help of a hawala trader. However, Tamizhselvan and the Union Minister soon find out that Arjun had not lost his memory and has stolen even more of the black money. Arjun, confronted by Tamizhselvan and the Union Minister, reveals his motive for stealing the black money.
Arjun is from Manimangalam, a remote village with no basic amenities like roads, water, high schools and even proper housing and sanitation facilities. When the building of the only primary school in the village collapsed, he confronted the local MLA Sivagnanam, who had falsely claimed to have developed the village, instead pocketing all the money which was to be used for developing Manimangalam. Sivagnanam rudely sent him away, defending his corruption and even declaring that he would never develop the village. Following this, Arjun approached the Union Minister, who also turned out to be corrupt like Sivagnanam. Arjun's friends confront Sivagnanam and his men, who kill them all. It is at this stage that Arjun had decided to get back all the black money acquired by Sivagnanam (which was the ₹300 crore recovered earlier in the film) and the Union Minister and use it to develop Manimangalam.
Arjun takes Tamizhselvan, the Union Minister and Divya to Manimangalam, which is now a very well developed village. He reveals that he had used the money hoarded by the Union Minister along with Sivagnanam's ₹300 crore to develop the village and had given the credit to him, because of which the villagers now hold the Union Minister in high regard. Tamizhselvan drops all charges against Arjun, seeing that he had stolen the money which was black for good intentions and arrests the Union Minister. In the credits, it is revealed that Divya and Tamizhselvan involve themselves in the development of Manimangalam along with Arjun.",6.1

During his manager's daughter's wedding, he comes across Malarvizhi (Keerthy Suresh), a medical student from Kallidaikurichi in Tirunelveli district (Vishakhapatnam in Telugu Version), and immediately falls in love with her. Malarvizhi goes to the Koyambedu bus station to leave Chennai, where Bhairava comes to propose his love, when he notices that she is cornered by a group of thugs with intent to kill her, as she was allegedly involved in an attack on a Union Minister's son Charan (Roshan Basheer). However, they retreat after receiving a call from Periyakannu alias PK (Jagapathi Babu) from Tirunelveli, who tells them not to harm her.
When confronted by Bhairava, Malarvizhi narrates her flashback. She studies at PK Medical College in Tirunelveli, whose chairman is PK, a criminal and politician who rules Tirunelveli along with his right-hand man Kottai Veeran (Daniel Balaji). The college has no basic facilities, including a proper building and good doctors. Malarvizhi and her best friend Vaishali (Aparna Vinod) lodged a complaint against the college to the MCI, upon which they decided to blacklist the college. To save his reputation, PK made a deal with the MCI officials to revoke the suspension in exchange for sex with a girl from the college. Vaishali was the girl chosen by the officials. The next morning, she was found raped and killed. Malarvizhi's father (Aadukalam Naren), a sincere police officer, began an investigation in Vaishali's death, but he was killed as well by PK in retribution. Later, Malarvizhi filed a case against PK in the court, where the judge ruled that Malarvizhi should not be expelled nor harmed till the case is resolved. Though PK upholds the judge's ruling, he harasses Malarvizhi indirectly. He plans to kill her once the verdict is declared in his favour. During the marriage, Malarvizhi had given the video evidence of Vaishali being raped to Charan. As he is the son of a Union Minister, she believed he could pull strings in NIC, to investigate the video. Charan was also attacked by PK's henchmen when they chopped his hand and they took the evidence.
On hearing Malarvizhi's story, Bhairava decides to help her fight back with PK and get justice for Vaishali. Impersonating as an Income Tax officer, Bhairava raids PK's mansion and collects evidence which holds PK responsible for Vaishali's death. Soon, the Lion and Tiger game begins between Bhairava and PK. In the process, PK gets back the evidence and destroys them. Bhairava manages to get five more days from the court to gather the required evidence. Meanwhile, Kottai Veeran's wife, who was terminally ill, passes away. Bhairava decides to take advantage of Kottai Veeran's love for his wife to make him approver against PK. Hence the former switches PK's asthma inhaler with nitrous oxide. PK, who inadvertently inhales the gas before Kottai Veeran's wife's funeral, begins to uncontrollably laugh at the funeral, causing Kottai Veeran to turn against him and accept Bhairava's offer of becoming an approver, turning against PK. In revenge for betraying him, PK confronts Kottai Veeran and hacks him to death.
Hearing about Kottai Veeran's murder by PK, Bhairava frames the latter for plotting to assassinate the Prime Minister of India on his plan to visit the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, as a result of which a shoot at sight is ordered against PK. He then disguises himself as a NSG commando, blends in with the real NSG commandos and kills PK.
In the end, the verdict is declared in favour of Bhairava and Malarvizhi. PK's henchmen are arrested while the students of PK Medical College are shifted to another college. In a press conference, Bhairava, while supporting private colleges, says that it is important that the person heading such colleges are honest and sincere enough to ensure that the students are safe and receive a good education. Hence the movie ends on a happy note with Bhairava and Malarvizhi getting married, thus reunited with each other.",5.9

Kalyan ensures that his channel does not report anything negatively about Dheeran and receives kickbacks in return. Also working for Zen One TV is Malar (Madonna Sebastian), who is Thilak's ex-girlfriend. Though Malar avoids Thilak initially, she soon realises her feelings for him and they get back together.
One day, Malar gets the news that her friend Kalpana (Darshana Rajendran), who is a social activist, has been raped with the blame put on her boyfriend Abdul (Vikranth). Thilak, Creative Head Ashok (Five Star Krishna) and Malar manage to smuggle out Kalpana from hospital and convince her to tell her story. Kalpana had been raped by Dheeran's goons in retribution for protesting against Dheeran's pesticide factory, which had ruined a once-prosperous village due to the effluents coming out of the factory, and the blame was put on Abdul instead. This confession is telecasted live and Kalpana gains massive support from the public. However, Kalyan soon telecasts another video which depicts Kalpana as ""mentally ill"" and had tried to malign Dheeran due to her ""mental state"". Enraged, Thilak attempts to expose Dheeran during a talk show, despite being bound by the Zen One management to ask questions framed by them to Dheeran.

A few months later Sengutuvan and Ilango see the couple, now married. The girl, Chanakya(Nikki Galrani), seems unhappy and is verbally and physically abused in public.
A Chinese businessman comes to the city looking to acquire the Emerald stone (Maragatha Naanayam). He hires a contractor John (Mime Gopi) who has connections with local mobs that could do the job. He offers Rs 10 Crores for the contract, but no one would touch the job as they are afraid of the curse.
During one of their routine smuggling encounters, Sengutuvan and Ilango are caught by the police officer that was pursuing them. They are taken into interrogation, where a senior police officer, sympathetic to their boss, reveals what they are doing is small time business and lets them go. Sengutuvan who has bigger ambitions is disappointed and tells his boss they should do something big. He, however, is not motivated. Sengutuvan decides to pursue the contract to find the Emerald stone on his own and is later joined by Ilango.
Ilango convinces Sengutuvan to approach a local priest (Kota Srinivasa Rao)who could protect them from the curse. Sengutuvan is unconvinced with the stories. The priest then hands him a lemon, at which point the ghosts of the 132 people killed by the curse are revealed to Sengutuvan. The priest tells them if they are going to pursue the stone, they will need to seek the help of one of the ghosts.
Back home Sengutuvan and Ilango complete the ritual to summon one of the ghosts, Ilango's uncle who was killed by the curse. But before the ghost could appear they are interrupted by the news that Ramadoss has died from heart attack. They attend to his funeral and return home. Ilango wakes up to find Ramadoss whom they buried the day before, standing in front of him. It turned out during the burial, the lemon fell out Sengutuvan's pocket on to dead hands of his boss. Ilango's uncle's ghost possessed the body and has appeared in front of them as summoned.
Regretting their decision they want to send the ghost back. But the priest tells them once summoned for a job they must finish it, or terrible things will happen to them. Ilango's uncle ghost tells them they will need to bring back three more of his friends for the mission. For which they will need to find 3 corpses. The ghost can tell when and where someone is going to die and he directs them to gather the three bodies. The first is an old panhandler (Sangili Murugan)who died alongside the road. The second is a man (Arunraja Kamaraj) decapitated by a freak accident. The third happens to be Chanakya who Sengutuvan had a crush on, as she hangs herself. Ilango's uncle successfully bring two of the ghosts to their new bodies. But one of them, a Tamil teacher, has trouble staying in the old panhandler's body and keeps jumping in and out of the corpse.
Sengutuvan, Ilango and the three ghosts, now in their borrowed bodies pursue the Emerald stone. Following the initial lead, they interrogate Pandurangan (M S Baskar) while posing as the henchmen of the most powerful local gang leader Twinkle Ramanathan (Anandaraj) This leads them to recover an emerald medallion, which turns out to be a fake. But their methods draws the attention of Twinkle He previously rejected the idea of pursuing the stone, but changes his mind.
After realizing they recovered a replica, the group continues to piece clues together. They find the man who made the fake. As he is dying, the man gives them clues to who ordered the fake medallion - a local Doctor. They find his son, who is also a Doctor and kidnap him. Before they can get him to tell them where the original medallion is, they are rounded up by Twinkle's men and are taken to his torture chamber. They manage to escape the torturers and eventually manage to find the original.
Despite the warning from Ilango's uncle, the two men Sengutuvan and Ilango could not fight the temptation and touch the stone, and thereby cursed.
They arrange for a meeting with the Chinese businessman for the exchange. But on the way, they are pursued by a mysterious driverless truck. The sight of which reminds the ghosts how they were killed - by the same truck. John and the Chinese businessman are run over by the truck and killed. Sengutuvan manages to elude the truck initially and recover the suitcase full of money.
They then run into the Tamil Teacher who is in the panhandler's body. He tells them they must return the stone to the grave of the king to lift the curse. On the way to the grave site, they are pursued by both the mystery truck and Twinkle's gang hellbent on taking the stone from them.
The group manages to elude both and get to the grave site. Before they can return the stone the gang shows up. Sengutuvan tries explaining the curse to Twinkle. But he wouldn't listen. He then makes a deal that they will place the stone in the grave, which they can then take. Twinkle agrees to it. Sengutuvan and Ilango place the stone in the grave and therefore released from the curse. Twinkle has one of his men recover the stone.
Having completed the job, Sengutuvan and Ilango bid goodbye to the four ghosts. And the ghost inside Chanakya's body allows Sengutvan to listen to the voice of her and propose him. And then her body is also buried. They bid a sad farewell to Ilango's uncle.

2017,Vikram Vedha,Tamil,Pushkar-Gayathri,"R. Madhavan, Vijay Sethupathi, Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, Shraddha Srinath, Kathir",crime thriller,"The story begins with an animated interpretation based on the classical Indian mythology of King Vikramadithyan and Vedhalam. The influences from this traditional mythology correlates with the story of a police inspector, Vikram (R. Madhavan), (who is brave, honest and draconian about right and wrong) and a dreaded crime lord, Vedha (Vijay Sethupathi), (who is wise and seems to understand the grey shades between good and bad) in the present era. Vikram and his colleague Simon (Prem) are part of an 'encounter' unit led by the latter, formed to eliminate the dreaded crime lord, Vedha (Vijay Sethupathi). On one such encounter, the squad kills a few gangsters, framing the death of an unarmed criminal to avoid further inquiry. When a new recruit, Santhanam (Manikandan) is nervous about this, Vikram calms him by saying that he sleeps peacefully at night despite the encounters because he knows that the men he shoots are criminals, and not innocent. The unit makes plans for another raid when, Vedha walks into the police station and surrenders.
Vedha is totally impervious to intimidation and does not acknowledge the police officers until Vikram walks into the interrogation room. Vedha cheekily offers to tell him a story but Vikram, who believes that all evil must be severely punished, shows no interest. Vedha asks Vikram to only listen and then adjudge what is evil and what is not.
Vedha's first story is about how he, a henchman in a cocaine smuggling gang, endeared himself to the boss, Cheta (Hareesh Peradi), and eventually rose to become a gangster and smuggler himself. Vedha actively dissuades his intelligent brother, Pulli, to stay away from crime. However, he is forced by a rival gangster, Ravi (Vivek Prasanna) to carry drugs. When Pulli is caught by the police; he confesses and Ravi is arrested. Under his boss's orders, Ravi assaults Pulli, which leaves a permanent mark in his hand. Vedha asks Vikram if Vedha should kill Ravi who committed the act or his boss who gave the order. Vikram replies that Ravi was merely an instrument; the boss was the real culprit. Vedha replies that he did kill the boss. At this point Vedha's lawyer intervenes and Vedha is bailed out. Vikram is stunned to find out that Vedha is represented by his wife, Priya (Shraddha Srinath).
Vikram realises that unarmed person shot in the last encounter was Pulli, based on a scar in his hand. Vikram assumes Vedha might try to kill Simon, as Simon is instigator of the encounter. Vikram rushes to save Simon only to find him shot and killed by Chandra (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar), Pulli's girlfriend, who has also been killed. The Superintendent of Police (Achyuth Kumar), head of the encounter unit, puts it down as a botched encounter and closes the case. Priya refuses to divulge Vedha's whereabouts to Vikram, which tests their marriage. Shocked and angry, Vikram raids Vedha's tenements, captures him and brings him into the woods to shoot him, when Vedha pleads with Vikram to listen to another story, as his last wish, which may reveal something about Simon's death.
The second story starts with Pulli, now grown up, offering to launder Vedha's ill-gotten income by investing it in shares. Vedha's boss, Cheta invests five million rupees into this venture. One day Chandra is supposedly kidnapped and the money is missing. Chandra later returns and reveals that she had stolen the money to start a new life, away from the tenements and crime, but her love for Pulli brought her back to him. Vedha returns the money to Cheta, but is ordered to kill Chandra for betraying Cheta in the first place. Vedha now asks Vikram if he should respect his boss and carry out the order or if he should follow his heart and disobey Cheta, an action that would escalate into an all-out gang war. Vikram replies that he should support Pulli as he is innocent and oppose Cheta, to which Vedha agrees. Vikram stumbles for a moment when he realizes that Pulli was innocent. In that moment, Vedha attacks Vikram and flees, after telling him to investigate Simon's and Pulli's deaths.
A troubled Vikram starts investigating Pulli's death. He recalls that Vedha opposed Cheta and managed to get Pulli and Chandra out of the city, and wonders why Pulli was present at the site of the encounter. He also notices that Chandra was tortured prior to her death. Vikram finally discovers that Ravi, once Vedha's underling, was behind the initial shootout which, to Ravi's advantage, would have decimated Vedha's stronghold. Vikram informs Vedha, who tracks Ravi down and brings him to an abandoned factory. Vikram arrives to find Ravi, beaten within an inch of his life. Vedha proceeds to tell Vikram the third and final story.
Vedha had sent Pulli and Chandra to Mumbai away from Cheta. Vedha begins to notice a surprising pattern: only his men are being systematically targeted and eliminated by the police. Vedha himself narrowly manages to escape when his friend sacrifices his life for him. Based on Ravi's confession, Vedha narrates that Simon was paid by Ravi to gun down his men. Vedha asks Vikram if Simon was in the right; since he became corrupt to get the money to pay for an expensive medical procedure for his young son, and Vedha's men were gangsters who deserved to die anyway. Vedha then kills Ravi and escapes before Vikram can answer.
The encounter unit arrives and castigates Vikram for letting Vedha escape again. Vikram slowly pieces everything together. The entire unit had come into sudden money which could only be traced back to Ravi. The SP reveals that Ravi had paid them to kill Vedha and Chandra's abduction was intended to get Pulli from Mumbai, which would then lure Vedha out of hiding. The guilt-ridden Simon had arrived early that night to save Chandra, not to kill her, but they were both killed, and their deaths covered up. At this point when the unit prepares to kill Vikram, Vedha appears again and saves him. A gunfight ensues, where Vikram shoots and disables his colleagues, who were mere instruments but kills the SP, the instigator. Vedha, who had acquired a firearm turns on Vikram to find Vikram has a gun on him. Vikram asks Vedha if he should let Vedha go for saving his life or kill him since he is a criminal. The film ends with the standoff between the two men.",8.6

2017,Aval,Tamil,Milind Rau,"Siddharth, Andrea Jeremiah, Anisha Victor",horror,"The film opens with an ancient Chinese mother and daughter. They seem to spend happy moments with each other with the mother being pregnant. The movie then moves to the present where a happy couple Krishnakanth aka Krish (Siddharth) and Lakshmi (Andrea Jeremiah) make love, bringing in their memories of the times they met and how their love blossomed. They then notice that a new family is moving into the next house. Krish is a neurosurgeon who specializes in deep brain stimulation (DBS) to cure Parkinson's. He is close to another doctor, Dr. Prasad, who is a psychiatrist.
The two families get along well, with Jennifer aka Jenny, who is the eldest daughter having a crush on Krish. Everything goes well when suddenly during a dinner party, Krish sees Jenny jumping into the nearby well. Informing the family, he jumps into the well and saves her. Lakshmi who is angry at Krish for impulsively jumping into the deep well, quarrels with him that night before Krish forcefully kisses her and both end up having sex. That night, Jenny has seizures and once again, Krish helps her in time. During another dinner at Krish's house, Jenny panics after seeing a strange figure and her parents forcefully take her home. The people in the house start noticing strange things. The next morning, Jenny, once again not being self-aware, goes towards a cliff to jump. Sarah, who follows her, slips towards another cliff, but is saved by Krish.
When Paul goes towards Jenny to stop her, she herself returns home without saying anything, while still in a trance & passes out in the house. Her father then takes her to the psychiatrist on Krish's recommendation and she reveals two specific things that she thought was abnormal: a voice speaking to her in Chinese and another terrifying incident in the toilet. The psychiatrist feels that something is wrong and visits Jenny's room one day with the permission of her father who takes her out. He tries to decipher her mental state by reading the condition of her room, while also finding recent internet searches about ghosts in her tablet, and a book about exorcism lying in her drawer. Upon seeing this, he concludes that Jenny must've made up an image in her mind that she's possessed by a spirit. So, he, Krish, and Jenny's dad plan to administer fake exorcism with the help of a church pastor, Father Joshua in order to bind the spirit. All hell breaks loose in doing so, revealing that she is really possessed by a powerful spirit of the Chinese mother, resulting in Father Joshua getting injured and admitted to the hospital in a comatose state.
Jenny returns to a normal state, but to confirm what is going on, her grandfather calls on a psychic. But Jenny's father dismisses him. One night, the servant in the house prepares a voodoo doll to chase the bad spirit, but is scolded by Paul not to do occult in house. The same night, she is hit by the ghost in the same way as the voodoo doll, while being wrapped by her own shawl, impaled on the head by a nail. The next morning, when Paul looks around her room, he finds the Voodoo doll under the bed and what appears to be fingernail marks below the bed frame. Evidently spooked, he tells his father to call the psychic. Using his power, the psychic talks to the spirit, who signals to him that there are not two, but three spirits in the house, with the third one being revealed to actually be a malevolent force which would not let them leave the house.
Lakshmi announces that she is pregnant, but within a few days, she falls off a ladder, while seeing a scary figure on the water tank, who was actually attempting to cause her a miscarriage, but the child survives. Krish gets suspended as he was constantly distracted by these figures, while in the operation theater causing a hemorrhage to the patient being operated. Dr. Prasad, with the help of a local police inspector, starts researching about a family that used to live in that house finding out that there was an eye witness who knew what happened to the family. Simultaneously, the psychic too, using the comb which belonged to the Chinese daughter, begins to place the pieces of the mystery. When Dr. Prasad and Krish go to see the witness in a village, she tells a flashback when she was eight years old. It is revealed that the house belonged to a rich Chinese silk merchant who lived with his wife and daughter. He wished that his pregnant wife should bear a male child. As he was a Satan worshiper, he had to sacrifice a girl child during the time of the solar eclipse to get a male child.
To achieve this purpose, he kidnapped the then eight year old witness when she was collecting flowers in the garden nearby as usual. The eight year old was saved in time by his wife, which left him with no option, but to sacrifice his own daughter. He hit his wife, until she fell unconscious. Luring his daughter, he beheaded her using a sacrificial sword. His wife, regaining her consciousness, couldn't bear the sight of her dead daughter on the floor. Cursing her husband, she took a knife and pierced herself in the abdomen, killing herself and the unborn child, telling him that she does not need a male child by sacrificing a female child. The husband, realizing his loss, takes his own life by drowning in the nearby well.
Returning to the present, the father orders his family to pack up and leave the house. Lakshmi is being chased in the hospital by the two spirits only to guide her to Father Joshua’s room. Being the day of the solar eclipse, the old woman speculates that the Chinese merchant would return to complete his ritual. Lakshmi calls Krish and tells him that she is discharged and is headed to see Jenny. Krish too comes back from the village at the request of Lakshmi to stay with Jenny. Lakshmi then tricks Krish and locks him in Jenny's room for impeding him till the eclipse ends. She then reveals what Father Joshua had seen on the day of exorcism. Though Jenny was set free, some other force tried to stop the prayers of Father Joshua in the room. The force was from none other than Krish. When Krish had jumped into the well the other night to save Jenny, the Chinese merchant’s spirit possessed him. Meanwhile, the psychiatrist being in the same room as Krish also figures that the Chinese merchant and Krish have common dates of birth. Krish being possessed, kills the psychiatrist in a gruesome way and escapes through the window.
It was from Krish that the spirits of the Chinese mother and the Chinese daughter were trying to protect the family by frightening them to leave the house. As the eclipse begins, the spirit of the Chinese merchant takes full control of Krish and he begins searching for his target, which is revealed to be Sarah, to sacrifice and complete the ritual. Though he lures her and tries to kill her, the family members and the spirits of the Chinese mother and the Chinese daughter fight with Krish by trying to distract him, until the eclipse ends and they finally succeed in removing the spirit from his body.
In the end, Krish and Lakshmi are shown to be settled in Goa. Jenny, along with her dad comes to meet them. When Jenny requests to meet their son, it is revealed to the viewers that Krish, being possessed by the Chinese merchant’s spirit had sex with Lakshmi resulting in a baby actually born of the Chinese merchant instead, which the couple is unaware of. The film ends with the camera panning towards the boy seated in a room, slowly revealing his face & focusing on the iris of his eye, which splits into double iris and the screen cuts to black.",7.9

Meanwhile, the doctor, who treated Chotta in the hospital comes to know from the news that Chotta is a wanted terrorist and informs the police. The police collect the CCTV footage from the hospital and the highway, which contained Madhu and Kulandai providing lifts to Chotta. Hence, they corner and arrest both of them. While being taken to custody, they are hit by a jeep and are injured, causing Kulandai to forget his past. Madhu thinks that Kulandai must be a real associate of Chotta and if he can make Kulandai tell the police that Madhu is not involved in this case, then he can escape. However, he is shocked to see Kulandai having forgotten his past. The case is handled by Dheena, who now gets a good chance to reject Madhu, as he doubts that he is a terrorist. Dheena plans to kill both of them in an encounter, but Madhu and Kulandai manage to escape. With help from Bhargavi, they all hide in her friend's flat, which happens to be just below the flat in which Chotta is hiding, in the same apartment.

Kulandai tells them that Chotta made a phone call from the petrol bunk's public phone and using lip reading, he manages to get the gmail username of Chotta and his associates. However, he could not get the password, as Chotta was turned the other side while saying that on the phone. With help from his friend in a telecom industry, Madhu gets the number to which Chotta made the call and tracks down the number to the same apartment in which they are currently staying at. He identifies Chotta and manages to grab him, but Chotta overpowers him and escapes. Madhu chases Chotta, but Chotta gets away with his female associate escapes in a car.

The police use narcotics to get the password from Chotta and Madhu successfully logs into his Gmail account. He finds out about the plan. Since Chotta instructed the bombers to check the mail just one hour prior to the attack, the draft message remains unchecked by the bombers.

The story shifts to the year of 1999, where Theeran is in his police training college undergoing training to be posted as DSP from TNPSC (Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission) exams. He tops the training period. Simultaneously in a house along the highway of Tamil Nadu a group of dacoits wreck the house by barging in killing all the people inside gruesomely and taking the belongings.

Therefore in 2003 Theeran and Sathya and a group of other police officers go around India to see if they are able to identify the fingerprints of the dacoits. During this process Theeran learns that these dacoits are actually tribe members of the left over cultural groups after the Indian Independence.

One day, Selvam is instructed to tape the incoming and outgoing calls from the house of a high-ranking official. During one such tapping, Selvam comes across a conversation between the official's wife and her secret lover, Balakrishnan, or ""Balki"" (Prasanna). Despite being a topper at his engineering college, Balki spends most of his time with seducing various young and married women through Facebook. By mere accident, Selvam discovers that Agal is also one of his many lovers.
Selvam then starts tapping his own wife's calls. He soon realizes that Balki is a sociopath who seduces women. After recording their conversations and rendezvous together, he blackmails them for money. Initially, Agal trusted balki as a good friend and shares all her secrets with him, Then she comes to know of Balki's evil intentions and blocks him on Facebook. Balki starts threatening Agal to sleep with him. Enraged, Selvam decides to take the matter in his own hands. With the help of a private detective, he gets the complete details of Balki and confronts him.
Balki reveals that he had already expected Selvam to confront him and he has already hacked Selvam's personal computer and stolen all the details of the tapping and evidences Selvam has collected so far. He has also secretly recorded Agal bathing at their home and uses this to blackmail Selvam. Selvam tries to abduct Balki but is forced to let him go after discovering that Balki has stored all the hacked data on his online Swiss bank account. If he does not key in his secret password within a specific time period on a day-to-day basis, the data will be leaked automatically, tarnishing both Selvam's personal and professional life.

When Balki returns home, he realizes that Selvam has broken in and ran away before he returned. He decides to enrage him even more by forcing Agal to meet him at his home. She comes only to tell him to leave her alone or she would tell her husband about him. Balki ignores her threats by coming straight to her home. Both Selvam and Agal pretend to be nice to him in order to keep their own secrets while Balki enjoys himself tormenting them.
To provoke Selvam even further, Balki leaks a tapping of the assistant police commissioner in order to get Selvam into trouble. Thinking he would get into trouble, Selvam is instead congratulated by his superior for putting fear in government officials and preventing them from ever misusing their privilege any further. However, when the scandal escalates, the higher-ups in the police decide they need a scapegoat to take responsibility and they try to frame Selvam. Realizing that his superior is manipulative, he threatens to leak their secret conversations unless they leave him alone. He also realizes that Balki is tormenting him for fun and is not serious about leaking the rest of the files. Selvam goes to meet Balki's estranged father to get his help to bring down the sociopath.
Selvam's Benami has invested all the money they have looted so far on the construction of a luxurious holiday resort in Langkawi, Malaysia. Selvam ignores all of Balki's phone calls and instead takes Agal to the resort for a short vacation. Once there, he reveals that he has been approached to become the head of security for this new resort and he plans to leave the police force. At the same time, Balki is infuriated that Selvam is ignoring him and comes to the resort to confront him. While Selvam is away, Balki breaks into their holiday suite and tries to rape Agal. As he is about to corner her, he falls unconscious, allowing Agal to escape. At the same time, Selvam returns and manages to break into Balki's Swiss account by using his eye for recognition. He erases all of the stolen data and saves everyone. It is then revealed that after Balki's father met with Selvam, he finally convinced his son to allow the old man to live with him, albeit as a servant. To stop Balki from doing anymore harm to society, his father has been slowly poisoning him with small doses of poison that eventually leads him into a permanent vegetative state.
Selvam and Agal return to India to make the final arrangements before they immigrate overseas. However, Selvam's Benami is shown mysteriously dead but is actually killed by the private detective (Susi Ganeshan) to loot all the property amassed by Selvam.",

2017,Maayavan,Tamil,C. V. Kumar,"Sundeep Kishan, Lavanya Tripathi, Daniel Balaji, Jackie Shroff",action drama,"The film starts with the death of a renowned neurologist and scientist Pramodh. His mysterious gym trainer (Sai Dheena) is seen paying his gesture of respect at the funeral before leaving. The plot then shifts to a young crime inspector Kumaran (Sundeep Kishan) chasing a petty thief, where by coincidence he witnesses the same gym trainer murdering his own wife. Kumaran chases the murderer who corners him and halts him with a blow to the head. In the ensuring tussle, Kumaran manages to kill the murderer. A meeting with psychiatrist Aadhirai (Lavanya Tripathi) ends on a rough note when she deems him medically unfit to rejoin the police force. Later when he himself faces symptoms which attribute to PTSD, he mends his ways with Aadhirai who helps him overcome his disorder. A second murder happens in which a famous actress is killed. Kumaran visits the spot and finding the similar blood stains from the earlier murder and many other similarities, including the same brand of cigarette smoked by the murderer, he is stressed up and gets into a shock. Aadhirai finds him and treats him for his PTSD and makes him normal. He meets with Rudhran and introduces her to him as a motivational speaker. Kumaran, now fitter, sets out his investigation and finds out that a makeup man (Mime Gopi) must have done the murder as he is the prime suspect. Upon investigation, He also gets to know that both the makeup man and the gym trainer showed a totally different behavior, few days before they committed the murders. Kumaran tracks down the makeup man but he jumps to death before confessing anything.
Next Murder happens and the victim now is a renowned scientist Mr. Narayanan (Kathi Ravi). Kumaran tries to find some evidences in the scientist's home and he finds a book written by Rudhran. Thinking that Rudhran might know the scientist, Kumaran visits Rudhran's office and finds that his behavior has changed. His own dog starts to bark at him and he has also started to smoke recently, that too the same brand that was found in the earlier murders. Kumaran deduces that some strange thing is happening and Rudhran could either be murdered or become the next murderer. He nabs Rudhran when he shows his more ruthless and cold blooded side when he kills his own dog. So Kumaran takes Rudhran into custody and while signing on the FIR, Rudhran signs a different name, and then corrects it to his own sign. Kumaran notices this and finds out that, the first sign was signed ""Pramodh"".
A brief investigation reveals that Pramodh is a colleague of late Mr. Narayan when they worked together at Indian institute of neurosciences. A senior official Velayudham (Jayaprakash) after hearing the incidents of the case, reveals that Pramod was involved in a project called Project Maayavan, which could enable a person to store his memories into a hard drive which can be transferred to another individual by injecting a newly invented gel, which would house millions of nano-transmitters and when injected into the brain these transmitters will attach onto the neurons. When the person dies, his memories could be transmitted to another individual whose brain would already have been injected with the gel. The memories of the new person will first be erased and the old person's memories will be transferred via the nano-transmitters. This way the person (his memories) will not die and will live for ever. To prove his theory Dr. Pramod works day and night, and during this experiment he even sends a patient to coma, but he is not bothered about human life and wants to succeed in his mission. After Dr. Narayan becomes the Director of the Indian Institute of Neuroscience he stops Dr. Pramod's project.
Raged by this, Dr.Pramod uses himself as the subject and successfully transfers his memories in a hard-drive and then commits suicide. Once he dies his memories gets transferred to the Gym trainer (who was already inserted with the gel by Pramod). And once he dies, he transfers his memories to the make-up man and now to Rudhran. By the time Kumaran solves this and finds that Pramod's next target is an army general Major Sathyan (Jackie Shroff), Pramod who is now living in Rudhran's body commits suicide and finally he successfully arrives into the major's brain. The major invites Kumaran and says that his technology will let him live for more than 1000 years and no one can stop him.
With a clue from Pramod's wife, Kumaran finds his secret lab where Pramod has his memories stored. Pramod successfully retrieves the hard-drive containing his memories black-mailing Karna and in the process killing him, his wife and his children and also killing Velayudham and DIG. He then kidnaps Velayudham and goes to the institute lab to let him switch to another body. Kumaran tracks him down and a gun-fight ensues. Finally Kumaran realizes that his girl friend (psychiatrist Aadhirai) is the next subject. If the major dies Dr. Pramod memories will transfer to Aadhirai's body, leaving Kumaran with a difficult choice.
Twenty years later, Kumaran is happily married to Aadhirai and they have a son. It is then revealed that Kumaran has trapped the major in his secret basement and has kept him alive all these years.",4.8
